Check out /r/choosemyalignment for a D&amp;D-themed judging experience!
✨Text✨
Greetings my judgmental friends! I would like to bring a rising subreddit to your attention: /r/choosemyalignment. 

CMA is a fresh take on the AITA/AITB formula where instead of being called a dick, you can submit a situation and the users will vote on your D&amp;D alignment. If you aren’t familiar with alignments, here is a chart:

https://wp-media.patheos.com/blogs/sites/124/2019/09/dnd-alignment-chart.jpg

Once your post has been judged, the bot will poop out a neat heatmap showing the break down of judgments you received like this: 

https://i.imgur.com/CbwqX1W.jpg

Just like for AITA and AITB,  the mods have crafted an intricate flair system where you gain XP by making posts and leaving judgments. As you gain XP, you will level up and get to pick a D&amp;D class and earn ranks. There are prestige classes available at the higher ranks and we are planning some class-based events for everyone to participate in.

So far it’s a really great sub with a cool concept, so I encourage you to check it out!

Coronavirus Post Moratorium: Updated
✨Text✨
Hola, amigos. It&#39;s been a long time since I rapped at ya, but I been workin&#39; for a living, taking what they&#39;re giving, all that.

We&#39;re relaxing the coronavirus moratorium a bit. The nature of corona related conflicts has changed along with the world. We&#39;ve largely moved out of concerns over traveling, shopping, panic behaviors, etc. Lots of folks are now facing very tangible interpersonal conflicts as a result of being shut inside with others. We don&#39;t want to shutdown any and all conflict where COVID-19 is tangentially present, but rather continue the goal of minimizing the spread of misinformation.

So what&#39;s the new standard? Simply put,

#This ban now extends to posts that ask for a judgment relating to possible or potential exposure or risk thereof. Please report these posts.

I will reiterate: Follow your local authorities recommendations and policies for quarantine/lockdown/stay at home/shelter in place/social isolation.

I will provide some examples below, but read these with the understanding that ***this is not an exhaustive list and should not be pointed to in the event your post is removed.*** We simply cannot anticipate every way someone may ask about exposure and these examples are provided to help illustrate the line.

**Examples of approved posts:**

* Conflicts about priority access to internet/tech for school work, working from home, gaming/streaming, etc.

* Financial conflicts because you lost your job when everything closed

* You&#39;re butting heads with the people you live with as a result of being stuck together

* Changing household dynamics as a result of you suddenly having to work from home

**Examples of banned posts**

* Can your roommate still bring their SO/friends over?

* You yelled at someone for getting to close to you

* Your family is pissed you refuse to go to someone&#39;s birthday/graduation/fuck-it-it&#39;s-tuesday party

* Someone wants you to get a job and you don&#39;t want to risk exposure

* Posts that will lead to a debate about the merits of lockdown, when/if certain activities will be safe, who counts as an essential worker, and similar.

Please note, if debates or other discussions which lead to the spread of misinformation around COVID-19 occur, they will be removed from comment section.

We hope everyone is staying safe and sane in these times.

AITA for dming a girl who bullied me relentlessly in high school regarding her instagram post?
✨Text✨
So I’m (21f) Asian. I went to a predominately white high school full of rich kids who were racist and super snobby. This one girl, we’ll call her B, bullied me relentlessly in high school and would make fun of my eyes (she would pull her eyes back when she saw me), call me Ling Ling, chink, ask me if Kim Jong Un was my dad, tell me to stop eating dogs, etc. All unprovoked, and I never said anything back because my Korean parents always told me to swallow my pride and take it.  She’s basically the worst human I know and she is part of the reason why I resented my asian heritage for so long.

I don’t follow her on social media because I don’t follow people I don’t care to keep up with.  She’s trying super hard to be an “influencer”, and there has been this trend going around called the “fox eye trend” where girls will pull their eyes back just like they would when they mock asian eyes in the attempts to look more “chic”. While this trend has made me upset because the feature I could not control and was teased for my entire life is now being considered sexy when non asian girls do it, I realize I don’t have much control over things like this so I just ignore it.

B posted a picture in this pose, pulling her eyes back, with some caption along the lines of “am I bella hadid yet?” 
This pissed me off (admittedly more than it should have) because she looked no different from when she pulled her eyes back to mock me. I saw the post because my friend, who was always there to listen to me when I was hurt by B, sent it to me, and we had talked about the fox eye trend a couple days ago. I then   in the heat of the moment dmed B saying “no, you don’t look like bella hadid, you look like the racist you are.. but like.. chic!”. She read the message, said “what the fuck..?”, and took down the post (I should make it clear that there were some comments NOT FROM ME on her post about the fox eye thing being problematic. I wasn’t the only asian she bullied). Now I feel bad for making a big deal out of something that might have been nothing.
AITA?

Edited because I realized I was kind of rambling lol.
ALSO: Just to clarify for those who keep saying to stop looking at her posts: Again, I don’t. I haven’t since I left high school because I don’t care. She posts racist stuff on twitter these days about asians because of coronavirus, which I only see because of twitter’s stupid “people you follow follow this person” feature. My friend ssent me this post specifically because we had talked recently about the fox eye trend and seeing  B doing it was just... amazing.

AITA for telling my stepdaughter she’s absolutely under no circumstances allowed to switch out my cats food for vegan food even though she’s losing weight because the sight of normal cat food makes her sick?
✨Text✨
Sorry for the appalling title. My stepdaughter is living with my husband and I for the next year. Shes an educated young professional who’s saving up to buy her own home. 

Since she’s moved in with us (past 3 months) she’s become increasingly snappy and unhappy with how her dad and I run our lives. We aren’t environmentally conscious enough because we don’t compost our waste, we are negligent because we leave lights on when we leave our home for security reasons, we should switch to electric cars, we are contributing to the inhumane treatment of cows by consuming dairy, the list is endless. 

My cat Mango is getting to be an old ass man and he has lived a full life of eating whatever the fuck he likes (obviously within what’s safe for a cat) and hes happy that way. My stepdaughter is now insisting she will purchase vegan cat food because seeing Mango eat meat makes her sick. 

We feed him in the kitchen and she will literally throw up / retch/ leave the kitchen if she sees him eat meat. She HAS lost a lot of weight since claiming that seeing Mango eat meat makes her sick, and we leave out dry biscuits for him to snack on which also makes her sick. It’s not like we leave mess out but even if she smells his food in the am (which is gross, yeah, but the doors are open and that’s just life if you have a pet) she will heave and walk away. 

Her dad and I both told her if she’s unhappy with it she needs to find someplace else to live and although we are genuinely sorry she’s lost her appetite and has lost weight we aren’t going to change Mangos lifestyle- she has yelled, cursed at us, cried, begged, etc, but no, we are NOT happy with Mango eating a vegan diet. We don’t feed him cheap crap either, we feed him food quality cat food that isn’t processed or full of sugar or grain. It’s pretty much gourmet Gordon Ramsey worthy cat food. 

My MIL has waded in after my stepdaughter told her we were being unfair by refusing to let Mango go on her preferred diet for him, and is accusing us of being cruel and shortsighted. She says we are letting her get sick, and that Mango won’t hurt from a change in diet but stepdaughter is hurting.

AITA for &#39;ruining&#39; a marriage because I made them sleep separately?
✨Text✨
This is so silly but they&#39;ve cut contact with me for it. So, a few days ago my cousin (48M) and his wife (31F) came to stay with me because their ac broke down and they were having trouble finding someone to fix it immediately(we live in a very hot country and they dont have ceiling fans). Im not really close with this cousin, but Im the only relative they have in the city and my  fiancé is living with his mother atm, so I had room. 

Cousin, wife and 4 year old arrived and we had a good time until I showed them where they were going to sleep. Fiancé  and i have separate rooms. Fiancé  has a queen while my room has two twins so it can be converted into a guest room if needed. I put the kid in my fiance&#39;s son&#39;s room, the couple in mine, and I moved into fiance&#39;s room like usual They went all quiet when I showed them the room, but I didnt really think anything of it. Later, cousin knocked on my door and asked to switch rooms because they werent comfortable sleeping separately. 

Now, my fiancé has expensive tech stuff for work in his room. The kid is hyperactive and in their room all day. First he got offended and said he was too well behaved to touch anything (He&#39;s not. Hes broken my stuff before) ,then asked if I could move the queen into the other room. I said, ok fine we&#39;ll see about that tomorrow but no no no, it had to be tonight. Well, it was late and there was no way but he thought that it would only take me a couple of hours. I said,&#39; wait, you&#39;re helping right?&#39;  but he said it was rude to ask a guest to fix something that was a result of my own &#39;lack of forethought&#39;. 

I just closed the door on him and went to sleep. Next morning, the wife was irritable through breakfast ( she tossed all the uncooked stuff I&#39;d left out into the trash without even asking me- including half a loaf of fresh homemade brioche ) and I could hear them having whispered arguments. In the afternoon he said they were going to stay with his friend and left.

I just thought good riddance and forgot about it until my grandma called today and said I&#39;d ruined their marriage and needed to apologize if i ever wanted to speak to my cousin again. Apparently, I have no right imposing me and my fiance&#39;s newfangled arrangement on others. 

But,I wasnt? I mean, my parents used to sleep separately if they had to in other peoples homes or hotels and i didnt think it was such a big deal. I know what my fiancé and I do isn&#39;t traditional but is always sleeping together so important in a marriage? What happens if one of them isnt home? I told my fiancé and he laughed but said that we should probably put the queen in my room to avoid this in the future. AITA?

AITA for demanding my brother gives me thousands of pounds for next few years after he crashed into my car when he had a seizure?
✨Text✨
I (19f) live with my parents. My older brother (25) moved back in at the beginning of the current event. My brother is an alcoholic, and he has epilepsy. His doctors have told him he should not drink at all, as alcohol will trigger his seizures because of the medication (I&#39;m not sure on the specifics but basically, he is not supposed to drink). When he takes his medication properly and doesn&#39;t drink, he rarely has seizures and can always sense them coming, and because of this, he is allowed to drive. Nobody advises that he does drive, though.

I live in the UK, and I passed my driving test last December. I bought myself a little car with my student loan, and I insure it on my own. My insurance is 1.5k a year, the car was 1k, and my income for the year is 7k as I&#39;m at uni and I only have my student loan. I pay my parents rent, around 1k for the year.

My brother recently went to the store for our family shop. The store is about a five minute drive from our house. Nobody is happy about him driving for the family shop, but my car is too small to carry all of the shopping. My parents don&#39;t drive. When my brother came back from the store, he had a seizure as he was coming down our street, and he swerved into the back of my car.

I was absolutely furious. Not only has he caused a lot of expensive damage to my car, as I am a new driver, when I report this to my insurance it will make my insurance cost for next year absolutely skyrocket and I probably won&#39;t be able to afford it. My parents were also mad at him, as he admitted he felt that he would have a seizure soon when he was in the store but he thought he would be able to manage the 5 minute drive home. It also came out that he had consumed 6 bottles of cider last night.

To me, this is disgusting and he absolutely knew the risks. I demanded he pay for the damages at least, and he should also pay the difference between what my insurance should be in the next years and what it is, until my insurance is manageable. I will use a comparison site to figure out what my insurance should be for next year if I had no claims, vs what it will be after my claim, and I expect him to pay the difference. My parents think I&#39;m being ridiculous because my brother doesn&#39;t work and is on benefits, but I don&#39;t care, because I worked so hard to get and insure my own car, which he damaged after knowingly increasing the risk of seizures dramatically. AITA?

EDIT: just to let you guys who aren&#39;t from the UK know, if you get into an accident THAT IS NOT YOUR FAULT in the UK, your insurance will probably go up. Even if it&#39;s not your fault. It will increase even more if it is your fault, but any accidents will increase the premium. Especially when you&#39;re a new driver.

AITA for telling my girlfriend she doesn&#39;t get special treatment on Mother&#39;s Day?
✨Text✨
Yesterday morning my girlfriend was being pouty and generally sour. When I asked her what was wrong she said that she was upset because I had not cooked her breakfast or brought her flowers or any of the things I do for her birthday or our anniversary.

Befuddled, I asked why I would do any of those things for mother&#39;s day, as we have no children? She thought that because we have two dogs she qualifies for mothers day. I laughed and told her that until she has a human child she doesn&#39;t qualify for mother&#39;s day. I had sent cards and flowers to my mother and grandmother so I guess she was expecting some too? She&#39;s still upset about it this morning.

AITA?

EDIT: I get that this is a communication issue, she should have given me an expectation that she wanted to have a special day. I will talk with her after work. No I am not even considering ending our 7 year relationship over this.

WIBTA if I ask my wife to stop listening to crime podcasts
✨Text✨
Title probably sounds bad but here we go. 

I am not a controlling person in my marriage. If my wife wants to go out she goes out, if she wants to buy something she generally gets it, if she wants to watch Vampire Diaries for 750,000th time go for it (while I watch something else elsewhere) 

But recently she’s started listening to a true crime podcast and it’s starting to affect our daily life. Since listening to this podcast, which she tells me is about unsolved murders she is starting to get very paranoid and wants to make huge changes to the house that I don’t personally feel are necessary and are not worth the money. 

She wants to add door and window alarms which is fine, I don’t personally want them but I can manage with those.

But now she wants to switch out our exterior doors with new ones that don’t have a window at all and also is looking into buying bars for the windows in case someone tries to break in through there. 

We do not live in a dangerous neighborhood at all and the crime map online I can look at shows a single case of domestic violence in a 2 mile radius of our house. 

Would I be the asshole if I ask her to stop listening to this podcast and try to work through her newfound fright in a different way?

Also of note as it’s definitely important we do have an almost 3 year old that she is of course worried about and could be fueling the majority of this.



EDIT: It’s a craftsmen style door. It’s private already there is only a small pane of glass near the top of the door that no human could fit through even if they broke it. And even if they broke it they couldn’t reach the deadbolt or handle to unlock it unless they were a wizard in which saw we’re fucked anyways.

AITA for decreasing my review for my computer repair guy from 5 stars to 2 stars?
✨Text✨
My computer recently crapped out, and I hired a guy to fix it who was recommended to me by a friend. He was the husband of my friend’s friend who has a small computer repair business, in addition to being a cop. He got it up and running again, which I was very grateful for. I gave him a 5-star review on Yelp.

The day after I gave the review, however, I was blocked from going on multiple sites that I frequently go on. When I clicked on them a notice came up that something called “Net Nanny” was blocking me. I’ve had this computer for years and never seen that before, so I figured my computer guy must have installed it.

I sent him a message, and he told me that he did install it while rebooting my computer, his reasoning being that I have three young kids who use the computer and that it helps protect them from bad/dangerous stuff on the web. I value my kids’ safety as much as any parent, but this seems like none of his business and really sketchy to install something on someone’s computer without their permission.

I told him I wanted it off my computer and he sent me instructions for how to take it off. He never apologized for installing it. I lowered my Yelp review from 5 stars to 2 stars and explained why in my review. The computer guy sent me a sort of pissed off message a few days later about it. AITA?

✨Title✨
AITA for getting upset at my in laws after they put a Disney-style family portrait which includes the woman my husband cheated on me with/mother of his illegitimate son in their living room?
✨Text✨
I’m still emotional about all of this and I just want some perspective.

Background: Two years into our marriage, my husband Kyle cheated on me with one of his colleagues, Madison. Kyle immediately admitted what happened and he said that it was a drunken one-time thing that they both regretted. We were having a rough patch in our relationship at that time because of the stress of being unable to conceive, so I tried to understand him and gave our relationship another chance. I was gutted when he later told me that Madison was pregnant, but what’s done was done and the only thing I could do was accept it. They now have a son, Kit. Kyle’s parents adore Kit and they have him once a week every Friday. I don’t begrudge them for that and I myself care about Kit like a stepson because none of any of this is his fault.

Which brings us to the issue. For Mother’s Day my FIL had an artist draw a Disney-style family portrait of their family. My MIL sent a picture of the portrait that they put in the living room of their house. My parents in law are in the middle, and to their left is Kyle’s sister Karla. Beside Karla is her husband and in front of them are their two kids. To their right is me, beside me is Kyle, and beside Kyle is Madison. Kit is in front of Kyle. My heart sank when I saw Madison. I have nothing against Kit being in the picture and I know that they my in laws are close to Madison too, but to have her in the portrait with Kyle between me and her… that just broke my heart.

I called my MIL and asked her if they could please keep that picture in their room or somewhere else in the house, not in the living room where I will see it every time we’re over because it reminds me that I will always share my husband with the woman he cheated on me with because she gave birth to the child that I don’t have with him.  My MIL apologized for hurting my feelings but said that they didn’t mean to upset me, they were just thinking of Kit and how they don’t want him to feel that her mother isn’t family to them. My MIL said that she will put the portrait in their bedroom instead. I told her that frankly I don’t know how they didn’t think that it would upset me, but if they move the portrait elsewhere then I accept their apology and that’s the end of the issue for me.

Hours later Karla called me saying that my complaining about the portrait made my MIL cry on Mother&#39;s Day and now my FIL is also upset that his gift to her, which they were originally both happy about, is causing all of this drama. Karla said I was out of line for telling my in laws what they can or cannot put in their living room, and that in reality Madison is part of their family because she is Kit’s mom. She said that I should learn to live with the fact that Madison will always be there as long as I’m married to Kyle because of Kit. I told her that I know Madison will always be there, but is it too much to ask them not to rub it in my face with a portrait showing my husband between me and Madison?

Am I really the asshole here?

\-

I&#39;ve read enough. It was a mistake to post here. There are comments that made me realize many things, but most just jump into conclusions and talk like they know things better than I do and everyone including me who don&#39;t agree with them is wrong. I already have enough toxicity in my life, I don&#39;t need more thanks.

AITA for refusing to help my boyfriend with his business after he publicly declared it was &quot;just him&quot;
✨Text✨
My boyfriend runs a small food business, has done for the last few years. I have my own job but since he&#39;s begin cooking professionally, I have always been involved. From helping with menus, doing his finances and packaging orders for delivery etc, I have always felt like it was partly mine. I have always assumed he saw it the same way as it&#39;s never been &quot;hey, can you help me with this&quot; but rather &quot;you need to do this today for me&quot; 

Although I have put some of my own money in this business, I never expected to be an equal partner but as I spend around 20 hours a week doing work for him, some credit would be nice. Up until recently, he would usually say &quot;we&quot; in most social media posts and I assumed that was both of us. It is really all the credit I needed.

The other day, he made an Instagram business post which was partly about how difficult it is to operate right now and (paraphrasing) said it was particularly difficult for him as he was doing this totally by himself. As usual, I proof read his post. I was pretty hurt to see the line about not having any help and I did bring it up. He said that it was better for the business if it looked like it was all him. 


A few hours later, he asked me to package up some orders for shipping. I retorted that he should do it himself if it&#39;s better for business. I was partly joking but he was furious in his reaction and I&#39;ve now told him I won&#39;t do anything for him. 

He&#39;s now trying to fill in some forms (something I normally handle) and struggling. The one friend I&#39;ve told thinks I should help him as it&#39;s not like I want a public declaration of my existence and this is a stupid fight. I think that if my work isn&#39;t being rewarded with cash, some basic respect would work well too. I also think it might be worth him learning how difficult yet mind numbingly boring some of the work I do for him is.

So AITA?

UPDATE.

Jesus, there are a lot of comments. I&#39;ve read through most and here is where I currently stand.

I have no intention in completely stopping doing work for him, or breaking up with him (or reporting him to the police for financial abuse as one DM helpfully suggested) but I do want him to gain at least some understanding of what I do. Over the last few years, I&#39;ve always done the majority of the BOH stuff as it&#39;s similar to my main gig and relatively easy for me but this role has clearly snowballed into a part time GM job and it&#39;s time I set some boundaries. 

Tomorrow I&#39;ll have a chat with him and if I&#39;ve not been made redundant from my actual job, discuss me maybe teaching him to do what I do and transitioning back into more of a helper role.

Tonight, he can suffer doing some emails.

AITA for telling my 9 month pregnant GF, we are not getting rid of our 4 month old puppy just because she’s getting “overwhelmed”!
✨Text✨
For starters she’s 39 weeks, she’s literally about to pop. She also got the dog without consulting me, it was literally a spur of the moment thing with her, and not one time did I bitch about it, or trip. He’s the loveliest Golden Lab mix with green eyes. I will say he’s a handful, and though our apartment is spacious, it’s only but so big. I feel like he sleeps most of the time, but when he’s in play mode, he can be a bit much. 

I pretty much chalk it down to the lack of special attention, obviously she’s pregnant so the urge to take him out and walk him on a consistent basis while I’m at work is rather non existent. I’m not saying she doesn’t at all, but I feel like a properly trained dog is gonna behave and adhere to house rules. I take him out at least twice a day, and to the park at least twice a week, though I’m well aware that he should be at the park more. 

Secondly I just feel like she’s missing the principle. She took on the responsibility, and now she’s “overwhelmed”. She even laughed when her sister in law suggested we put him on the side of the road at her sister’s mother day dinner... Not to mention she rushed into finalizing to move into our current apartment which she low key hates. She’s a serial offender when it comes to this type of stuff. 

Furthermore, I feel like I compromise with literally everything, whenever her 4 nieces and nephew want to come over I might bitch, but I give in. I give in to whatever she wants to eat, whatever she wants to drink, when we order food, I pay all the bills and utilities, I pay whenever she needs her hair done, etc... She literally has zero responsibilities. She hardly cooks, or cleans, and I get it she’s pregnant. 

I just feel as though, she can be a really selfish person at times, but this time she’s gone too far. I’ve invested financially and emotionally into the dog, and we haven’t even had him a full month. She gave me an ultimatum, which is “Me or the dog”, and I responded no, “it’s me and Cujo or nothing”. She also named him Cujo. I could be wrong in this entire situation, but I’m not budging.

✨Title✨
AITA for dming a girl who bullied me relentlessly in high school regarding her instagram post?
✨Text✨
So I’m (21f) Asian. I went to a predominately white high school full of rich kids who were racist and super snobby. This one girl, we’ll call her B, bullied me relentlessly in high school and would make fun of my eyes (she would pull her eyes back when she saw me), call me Ling Ling, chink, ask me if Kim Jong Un was my dad, tell me to stop eating dogs, etc. All unprovoked, and I never said anything back because my Korean parents always told me to swallow my pride and take it.  She’s basically the worst human I know and she is part of the reason why I resented my asian heritage for so long.

I don’t follow her on social media because I don’t follow people I don’t care to keep up with.  She’s trying super hard to be an “influencer”, and there has been this trend going around called the “fox eye trend” where girls will pull their eyes back just like they would when they mock asian eyes in the attempts to look more “chic”. While this trend has made me upset because the feature I could not control and was teased for my entire life is now being considered sexy when non asian girls do it, I realize I don’t have much control over things like this so I just ignore it.

B posted a picture in this pose, pulling her eyes back, with some caption along the lines of “am I bella hadid yet?” 
This pissed me off (admittedly more than it should have) because she looked no different from when she pulled her eyes back to mock me. I saw the post because my friend, who was always there to listen to me when I was hurt by B, sent it to me, and we had talked about the fox eye trend a couple days ago. I then   in the heat of the moment dmed B saying “no, you don’t look like bella hadid, you look like the racist you are.. but like.. chic!”. She read the message, said “what the fuck..?”, and took down the post (I should make it clear that there were some comments NOT FROM ME on her post about the fox eye thing being problematic. I wasn’t the only asian she bullied). Now I feel bad for making a big deal out of something that might have been nothing.
AITA?

Edited because I realized I was kind of rambling lol.
ALSO: Just to clarify for those who keep saying to stop looking at her posts: Again, I don’t. I haven’t since I left high school because I don’t care. She posts racist stuff on twitter these days about asians because of coronavirus, which I only see because of twitter’s stupid “people you follow follow this person” feature. My friend ssent me this post specifically because we had talked recently about the fox eye trend and seeing  B doing it was just... amazing.

✨Title✨
AITA for demanding my brother gives me thousands of pounds for next few years after he crashed into my car when he had a seizure?
✨Text✨
I (19f) live with my parents. My older brother (25) moved back in at the beginning of the current event. My brother is an alcoholic, and he has epilepsy. His doctors have told him he should not drink at all, as alcohol will trigger his seizures because of the medication (I&#39;m not sure on the specifics but basically, he is not supposed to drink). When he takes his medication properly and doesn&#39;t drink, he rarely has seizures and can always sense them coming, and because of this, he is allowed to drive. Nobody advises that he does drive, though.

I live in the UK, and I passed my driving test last December. I bought myself a little car with my student loan, and I insure it on my own. My insurance is 1.5k a year, the car was 1k, and my income for the year is 7k as I&#39;m at uni and I only have my student loan. I pay my parents rent, around 1k for the year.

My brother recently went to the store for our family shop. The store is about a five minute drive from our house. Nobody is happy about him driving for the family shop, but my car is too small to carry all of the shopping. My parents don&#39;t drive. When my brother came back from the store, he had a seizure as he was coming down our street, and he swerved into the back of my car.

I was absolutely furious. Not only has he caused a lot of expensive damage to my car, as I am a new driver, when I report this to my insurance it will make my insurance cost for next year absolutely skyrocket and I probably won&#39;t be able to afford it. My parents were also mad at him, as he admitted he felt that he would have a seizure soon when he was in the store but he thought he would be able to manage the 5 minute drive home. It also came out that he had consumed 6 bottles of cider last night.

To me, this is disgusting and he absolutely knew the risks. I demanded he pay for the damages at least, and he should also pay the difference between what my insurance should be in the next years and what it is, until my insurance is manageable. I will use a comparison site to figure out what my insurance should be for next year if I had no claims, vs what it will be after my claim, and I expect him to pay the difference. My parents think I&#39;m being ridiculous because my brother doesn&#39;t work and is on benefits, but I don&#39;t care, because I worked so hard to get and insure my own car, which he damaged after knowingly increasing the risk of seizures dramatically. AITA?

EDIT: just to let you guys who aren&#39;t from the UK know, if you get into an accident THAT IS NOT YOUR FAULT in the UK, your insurance will probably go up. Even if it&#39;s not your fault. It will increase even more if it is your fault, but any accidents will increase the premium. Especially when you&#39;re a new driver.

AITA for telling my girlfriend to shut the fuck up after she insulted my sisters thighs?
✨Text✨
I’m 30 and my 12 year old sister is living with me right now because mom and pops are vulnerable so it made more sense for me to care for my sis for the time being. 

She is a really great kid and tbh I feel in a lot of ways like she’s my own kid because my mom and dad don’t speak English so I kind of had to raise my sis in ways that they couldn’t. Hard to explain but I’m sure anyone with a secondary culture will get what I mean- my mom and dad are great parents but having an English speaking person to guide you through shit when you live in an English speaking country is invaluable imo and my sister trusts me with stuff she won’t necessarily trust my parents with. 

Anyway my girlfriend was FaceTiming me and my sister walked past in shorts and a t shirt cuz it’s hot. My ~~sister~~ gf waited til my sister had left the area ( but not the room) and made a face and said ‘maybe feed her less OP, her thighs are kinda chunky’ 

I saw red and told her to shut the fuck up (just came out my mouth) and immediately ended the call. My sister is a bit chubby but ffs who says stuff like that about a 12 year old girl. 

Literally. Everybody. I. Know. Has been texting me that I’m a POS boyfriend and that how can I disrespect my gf like that. I am expecting an apology from HER but to my shock everybody is expecting ME to apologize. 

So Reddit, AITA?

AITA For Not Baking Much For My Family
✨Text✨
I [16M] started dating my girlfriend 2 years ago. I also got super super into baking around that time. I bake a lot. My girlfriend loves desserts. So I&#39;ve given her a ton of stuff I bake, all kinds of different stuff. I often try to bake something new and then she gets to try something new. I honestly love baking way more than eating it. My girlfriend is the opposite.


Well recently she gave me a scrapbook she made. She had counted every thing I baked her apparently, and she gave me this scrapbook after I baked her, her 100th dessert. It was filled with a picture of every dessert I&#39;ve baked and pictures of me baking  and her eating. She wrote a paragraph about each item I baked. Each item was dated too. She had been working on this for 2 years. She also wrote a long letter on how proud she is of my baking hobby, thanking me for the sweets, and telling me how much she loves me. It was the sweetest gift I&#39;ve ever gotten and I honestly cried.


I showed my mom and sister expecting them to think its cute but they were pissed. They were angry I&#39;ve spent so much time baking for my girlfriend and not them. I just got into this habit and I loved making my girlfriend happy as well since she loves desserts.

AITA for telling my autistic brother the truth when he asked me why women don’t like him?
✨Text✨
I’ve got a younger brother (24) with Aspergers and he’s very high functioning albeit with his quirks. 

Recently I’ve moved back home during the stay at home orders to look after my parents. My brother still lives with them. I find out he’s been trying to date in recent months and confessed it’s been pretty unsuccessful for him. He even got to go on a first date but his date literally got up and left after about a half hour. 

I know exactly the reason why and it’s not flattering. For one thing my parents coddled him since he was a kid because he was on the spectrum and was the only boy in our family. My mom in particular always told him he was smarter and more advanced than everyone else who’s neurotypical. This has led to his belief today that he genuinely is smarter than everyone else, especially women who he thinks are inherently irrational, illogical people. 

So I know how he interacts with women like me or his other sisters. He tends to say very hurtful things first and when we get upset, he will then say things like “you are being irrational/hysterical/illogical, I’m just being honest and you can’t accept it.” This is like his catch phrase over the years and drives us absolutely INSANE. 

Anyways when he asked me I basically said, “listen the truth is your way of talking to women can come across as extremely demeaning and borderline sexist.” I told him he acts like he can read every woman perfectly when he’s pretty much always wrong. This struck the wrong nerve with him and he later complained to my parents that I attacked him over things he can’t control. 

Now I’m in hot water for “ruining his confidence” and I feel both bad and kinda relieved at the same time. This was the first time in my life I told him how annoying his behavior is because growing up our mom always blamed us whenever he got upset. But maybe I was too harsh? AITA for telling him what I said?

AITA for disowning my brother when he came out as gay, because of how he&#39;s treating his wife?
✨Text✨
I (21f) have a brother (28) who came out as gay last month. He has been married to my best friend&#39;s big sister (24) for four years, they have 2yo twin daughters together. I&#39;m really close with her, so I&#39;ve been trying to stay neutral in what has become a messy separation. 

My brother told his wife he&#39;s gay by sitting her down, and saying he had been sleeping with two different men for about six months. He said he is now sure that he feels romantic feelings for men, and also told her he has been sleeping with random men from Grindr for over a year behind her back. She obviously freaked out, asked him how he could do this, why didn&#39;t he tell her when he started having the feelings, etc. He said that he&#39;s always thought he was gay but he didn&#39;t want to come out because it might affect his career. She asked him what about the effect on her life? She is now a single mother to two toddlers. He was essentially very angry that she wasn&#39;t supportive of this, so he kicked her out of the house, with the kids. After she eventually found a place to stay, my brother moved in one of the men he has been having an affair with. 

Since then, he has had very little contact with the kids, as in speaking to them on the phone once a week maybe. He has expressed that he still doesn&#39;t want to be public about coming out, so he posted on Facebook that he has separated from his wife because they aren&#39;t in love anymore and hinted SHE was the unfaithful one (posting things like &#39;yeah, seems like someone in this relationship wasn&#39;t satisfied with just one man&#39;) and is basically being a dick.

I told him a couple weeks ago that he&#39;s a fucking asshole and I don&#39;t want to be involved with him anymore because I think it&#39;s disgusting that he&#39;s treated his wife like this. I told him I get that you have to come out in your own time, but you don&#39;t need to kick her out, ignore your kids and berate her, and you don&#39;t need to make comments that people will assume mean she was being unfaithful (he said this was a joke about him having two partners now? still fucked up). He said I&#39;m being a homophobic asshole, and that I don&#39;t know how hard it is to come out. He said that if I don&#39;t accept him, I&#39;m a bigot. He made mistakes and what not. I said maybe I will forgive him if he improves his behaviour to his wife, and he said he resents her for keeping him from sleeping with men for years. I gave up at this point. My sisters (17&amp;24) both think I&#39;m being homophobic, my mom agrees with me. AITA?

AITA? My parents took most of my wardrobe away as punishment and I said I didn&#39;t want the clothes back because it&#39;s obvious they&#39;re not actually mine.
✨Text✨
I got in trouble at school this fall, I&#39;m a junior in high school. 

(Edit to add what I got in trouble for since a couple people asked... I smoked weed with a guy in the woods after school once and got caught. I also made out with him a couple times and my parents found out about that too)

As punishment my parents took away a lot of my things; all my clothes except 3 pairs of plain jeans and 3 plain black shirts and my coat. And all my makeup and hair stuff, purses and shoes; saying I had to earn things back with good behavior, I don&#39;t get to engage in my hobby (fashion) till I&#39;ve earned it.

Anyway it was a shitty couple months but I came to a couple realizations.

It was actually kind of nice to not have to think about what to wear and how I look.  My friends knew what my parents had done and didn&#39;t judge me. I also told anyone who asked why I looked like I only had one outfit what was up and it was no big deal.

I know it was supposed to be a demeaning humiliating punishment to make me look bad at school but honestly it just makes them look bad when people at school know I&#39;m only allowed to wear one thing.

I don&#39;t want to have things that are just something someone else can hold over my head. I don&#39;t want the old clothes and makeup back, if I&#39;m gonna get back into that stuff I&#39;ll do it on my own terms; I&#39;ll buy my own stuff.

So I told my parents that I don&#39;t care if they keep the clothes and makeup; they&#39;ve made it clear that stuff doesn&#39;t belong to me. And it&#39;s gross to me to spend every day wearing clothes that aren&#39;t mine, that can be given and taken as punishment. I&#39;d feel gross and I&#39;d rather not wear them again.

So now my parents are mad because they&#39;ve got a lot of clothes boxed up in the attic that the family spent money on and that are going to waste. Nobody else can wear them; my mom isn&#39;t my size and my only sibling is my little brother.

I said I don&#39;t care, I want clothes that are my own and those aren&#39;t it. 

AITA for not taking the clothes back and letting them go to waste?

META: This sub is moving towards a value system that frequently doesn&#39;t align with the rest of the world
✨Text✨
I’ve enjoyed reading and posting on this sub for many months now, and I feel like I’ve noticed a disconcerting trend, lately. Over time, more and more of the posts seem to have A- a universal consensus on every post, with any dissenters massively downvoted and B- a shift towards judgments that seem (to me at least) to be out of step with how people in the real world judge situations.

Given that, I think it’s important to remember that even though the sub is not intended to be for validation posts or to be an echo chamber or to give advice on how people should behave in specific situations- in practice, a lot of times it is.

So just as a reminder- offline, people in your real life will think you’re an asshole if you take the last cookie when you know the child behind you wants it.

They’ll think you’re an asshole if you don’t stand up for an elderly person on a bus. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you don’t go out for drinks with your co-workers once in a while. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you don’t try to be involved in your child’s life, no matter how much support you pay. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you can’t help out your brother with babysitting once in a while, even if you’re childfree. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you wear nothing but underwear in your own home when your roommate has guests over. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you can’t detour for 10 minutes a day to carpool with a co-worker for a week while his car is in the shop.

The internet has its own values, and that’s fine. But in the real world, people who can’t just go along to get along most of the time? People who don’t want to mildly inconvenience themselves to help out the people around them? People who don’t seem to put any stock into the idea of collectivism? The people around them are going to consider them to be assholes.

So yeah. I love this sub, I love reading the stories and I find it very interesting to hear people’s opinions. But I personally think that probably more than 50% of the time, the people I know in real life would disagree with the sub’s judgement of who’s the asshole in a given situation. I don’t know if the disparity is just because of reddit’s demographics, or because people with alternate perspectives see the writing on the board and don’t want to get down voted to oblivion.

So even if you get 4000 replies on reddit saying that you’re totally in the right, if everyone in your real life thinks you’re an asshole, well… there’s probably a reason for that. And maybe this is just me, but I really wish we could have more discussion about if someone is being an asshole if they’re being inconsiderate or selfish, even if they don’t technically “owe” anyone anything.

Or maybe you believe that people offline are wrong, and we should continue to promote the individualistic value system seen on reddit both on and offline. That&#39;s a discussion worth having too.

Edit: Thanks guys, this is very interesting discussion so far. And lol don&#39;t just downvote the people who disagree with me/you, engage them without being combative.

Edit 2: I’ve never seen this movie, but it’s come to my attention that there already exists in this world an excellent TL,DR: “You’re not wrong Walter, you’re just an asshole”

UPDATE: AITA for wanting to go to the funeral of a girl that I helped get addicted to drugs?
✨Text✨
I want to sincerely thank everyone who commented. Everyone’s comments were appreciated, including those that were less than pleasant. 

Since I received such great advice on my original post, I felt like I had an obligation to update. And I’m trying to follow through on all aspects of my life, even internet ones. 

The funeral service was held this past Thursday. Before then, I brought all the advice I received online and brought it to the real world and talked to both my therapist and sponsor about how I was feeling and what I should do. 

My sponsor was straight with me and told me that I would be putting myself in danger by going and that I should do something else that day to grieve. 

When Thursday rolled around, I was a mess. I seriously considered both just going to the funeral or using again but instead I grabbed my dog and we went on a road trip. 

We went to the beach and just hung out the two of us. 

I’m doing okay this week, but obviously am still not doing great. 

I haven’t reached out to any of Marcy’s family and I don’t plan to. I understand now how devastating that would be. 

That’s it. Take care everyone.

AITA for pretending to get fired when customers get a temper with me?
✨Text✨
I am a high schooler with a weekend job at a coffee shop. My coworkers who work weekends are: 

James - the owners son, he goes to my school. He&#39;s a shift manager but it&#39;s not a real formal thing, he&#39;s a friendly guy.

Danielle - A college student who sometimes works weekends too.

So sometimes customers will come in and just be angry about such little stuff. Like literally blow up about nothing. I dunno if theyre in a bad mood already and looking for someone to take it out on or what, but it&#39;s a lot... Like how sad so your have to be to be a grown-ass man taking your anger out on high school and college kids.

So James and I were joking about having a little fun with them and hopefully getting them off our backs.

So one day I was at work and some guy was having a temper about how we don&#39;t make the coffee hot enough... Which I couldn&#39;t do a thing about because I gave it to him right out of the machine.

So James came in and was like &quot;sir is there a problem here&quot; and the guy started ranting at him too. So he was just like &quot;OP, this is unacceptable, you&#39;re fired.&quot; 

I started acting real sad, like &quot;no please don&#39;t fire me, my family needs the money, I need this job, pleaseeee&quot; and he played up being a hard-ass, telling me to take off my apron and leave.

The angry guy started to backtrack, like &quot;It isn&#39;t that big of a problem, you don&#39;t need to fire her over it. I didn&#39;t mean it&quot; and James was like &quot;No, we pride ourselves on the best customer service&quot;

Of course after all that drama I still had my job, we were just acting. And we&#39;ve done it a couple times, whenever a customer will lose their temper at Danielle or I, James will storm in and &quot;fire&quot; us. And almost every time, the person who had come in angry will apologise and say that they didn&#39;t mean it. It&#39;s kind of satisfying, making people realize their actions might actually have consequences. 

Anyway, I was telling my friends from school about this and a few of them thought it was a mean prank, to let someone go away thinking they&#39;d gotten someone who desperately needs the money fired.

AITA for this joke?

✨Title✨
AITA for making a dad joke?
✨Text✨
Note. My step-daughter, Madeline, was about a year old when I married her mother, Jessica. Madeline’s father died before she was born. 
 
Madeline is currently 15, and she’s rebelling for almost everything. She did something bad, so while picking her up, I set a punishment up for her. Then she said “You’re not my dad. I don’t have to follow you”. Honestly, I got a bit hurt from that. But I understand that she didn’t mean it, and that she’d probably change. I just replied “I’m still your legal guardian for the next 3 years, and as long as your in my house, you have to follow my rules.” 
 
That happened about 2 days ago. So our family was going grocery shopping, when Madeline said “I’m hungry. I need food.” I decide to be extremely cheeky and say “Hi Hungry, I’m not your dad.” My son just started to laugh uncontrollably. My daughter was just quiet with embarrassment. And my wife was berating me “Not to stoop down to her level.” 
 
I honestly thought it was a funny dad joke. And my son agrees. So AITA?
 
Edit: I did adopt her. So legally I am her parent.

 
Mini Update: I’ll probably give a full update later but here is what happened so far. I go to my daughter’s room after dinner and begin talking with her. “Hey. I’m really sorry that I hurt you by the words I said. And I am really your dad. I changed your diapers, I met your boyfriend, and I plan on helping you through college. And plus I’m legally your dad, so we’re stuck together. But seriously, I’m going to love you like my daughter even if you don’t think I’m your dad. Then I hugged her. She did start to cry. I assume that’s good.

UPDATE: WIBTA if I took over planning my own funeral from my very religious parents?
✨Text✨
Hello, everyone. First of all, thank you all for the kind words, support and love that everyone has offered and given. These weeks have been the most difficult I have ever experienced and it is with great sadness that I tell you all that my beautiful and cat crazy wife, has passed. I&#39;ve had to cut this short due to character limits, sorry all. But, she did leave all of you a note, Reddit. I&#39;ve copied everything verbatim below. She truly loved everyone and was smiling so much after her first post. I&#39;ll take my leave here. Much love.

&quot;Reddit! If you&#39;re reading this, I am dead. Pretty crazy to be talking to a dead person, eh? It feels a bit strange to be writing this. If this feels a bit disconnected, I&#39;m sorry. I have to take frequent breaks as I get tired pretty quickly now. My husband offered to write these words (such a sweet ham, I know. Be nice to him, okay?). But, I wanted my last words to be written by me. Long story short, we talked to my parents. A lot of people asked about why my husband wasn&#39;t planning the funeral and my parents were taking control. Honestly, my parents didn&#39;t take the news of my passing to come well and I suppose their closure(?) was to try and take control of what they could. I&#39;m not angry at them for it, I understand. They had already pre-paid a large portion of the service and to put it plain and simple, it was a shit hand they were dealt. So, we talked to them. I laid it all out for them and somehow, we reached a compromise. Lots of tears. Lots of hugs. And surprisingly, lots of laughs. They admitted that they had been losing their faith with everything that had happened and their way to attempt to find it again was to take control and &quot;guide me&quot; into the afterlife. Not my thing though and I explained that I am not them, but their daughter who wanted to live her last weeks in peace, not the turmoil they were putting me through. And while a lot of people stated that funerals are for the living (true true), I firmly believe that a funeral is for the living to remember that person as WHO they were, not what anyone else wanted them to be. My parents seemed to understand when I told them that. They were not on board with the party favor aspect though, kind of a bummer. Pretty lucky to plan my own funeral, honestly. But, now that that is all said and done! Thank you, guys. I was blown away by the responses.I was moved to tears and I wish I had had the chance to meet every single one of you. You all be good now, ight? Take it one day at a time and fucking enjoy yourself! You only get one life, unless you&#39;re someone who has survived death than you&#39;re just a fucking hero and probably a cat with a few lives to spare. I love you all. I&#39;m resting easy now. This disease sucks and I&#39;m happy to be rid of it. And laugh and love and cry and be sad. Shit happens. I&#39;ve got to go now, I&#39;m gonna go snuggle my husband and my cats. Keep it real, Reddit. Love you, all!&quot;

UPDATE, AITA for despising my mentally handicap sister?
✨Text✨
I&#39;m back like I said I would be,. My [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/awyi8k/aita_for_despising_my_mentally_handicap_sister/) got a lot of attention and seeing as you guys seem interested, here&#39;s my update.

Well, since that day I made the post i&#39;ve been staying with my grandfather. The week&#39;s been honestly a huge change for me for better and for worse but i&#39;ll try to run it down.

I started by telling my grandpa the story of why I broke down the way I did and to be honest, he seemed horrified. No one in my family knew my parents were using me as essentially a free care service for my sister. My grandpa told me some things that I don&#39;t feel comfortable repeating here but in essence my sister is &quot;supposed&quot; to be getting care from a professional and that my parents were ignoring that, along with this I was not supposed to be caring for her at all with her mental state as apparently she is a danger to herself and others. With everything else I told him, along with stuff like the movie indecent he was really mad and told me to not contact my parents without him there. He pretty much told me that he would be meeting with my parents beforehand and that he was going to be there when I sat down with them. It didn&#39;t end here either, the rest of the week consisted of other family checking in on me and telling me things my parents hid from me. This included the fact that my parents have been taking money from family to fund a &quot;caretaker&quot; that doesn&#39;t exist.

Suffice to say, this week has been rough. But, the upside is that even through all this, my extended family has been giving me more love than i&#39;ve felt in a while. My grandfather spent this last week &quot;making up for the time i&#39;ve lost.&quot; Encouraging me to spend time with friends and do things I want to do. My aunts and uncles have also been helping me through the week.

Well, Saturday night I sat down with parents to talk. It went badly to say the least. They came clean to me about everything. They told me things I will not repeat here. But they did not apologize. My parents still claim that I some how owed my sister my time. My father even saying &quot;You were put here to be her caretaker&quot;. I won&#39;t lie and say I was composed. After everything i learned I confronted them. On the fact that my sister needed a caretaker. The money my dad was taking from his sister, and a few other things. They denied it or made excuses. And in the end, we ended off in a worse place than before.

Today will be my last time talking to them for a while. After talking with my grandfather and uncle last night, I&#39;m not going back. Later today i&#39;m going there and picking up my stuff and moving in with my grandfather. When I graduate high school i&#39;m planning on leaving the state to go to school. My aunt has told me that the money she was sending my dad will be instead be coming to me from now on. My parents have called me twice since Saturday, neither of them were to apologize and only ask when I was coming home.

I won&#39;t be going back to them. Right now I still feel pretty uneasy about everything but I feel like that will pass. The rest of my family is showing their support to me and honestly, it feel great. But in the end I lost my parents. Over all of this, i&#39;ve learned something that I wished I saw earlier. I don&#39;t hat my sister. In fact I love her with all my heart. I should never have never projected my hate onto her. That was wrong, and someday I hope to make up for it. But for now I need to leave.

So, there&#39;s my update. Thanks again for the support my original post got. I really appreciate everyone who took the time to comment or show me support. Thanks you.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Thank you all so much! I wish I could respond to every single one of you but my lunch only lasts so long. I&#39;ll update tonight how the move out went but until then, thank you all. I want to say that your support has been amazing and your kindness means more to me than anyone could ever imagine.

&amp;#x200B;

Late edit: Wow, I never imagined my story would reach the popularity it did. I know it&#39;s kinda cliche and i&#39;ve said it a thousand times but thank you all. 

&amp;#x200B;

We just got back from moving my things out of my parents house. Every thing I wanted to take my grandpa and uncle helped move and it&#39;s at my grandpa&#39;s house now. I have my birth certificate, social security card, and every other document and record I could think of. My parents were quiet the whole time I was there. Shorty after I arrived my dad left with my sister and my mom only hovered over us silently as me moved. It took a while but as we left she broke down and told me she loved me and would miss me. I hugged her and said goodbye, and that was it. Even now I sit here and think if she really meant it. After this whole week of her not saying anything she waited till the end. I hope she meant it. Right now though, I think I just need to look ahead. Maybe one day me and my parents can reconnect. I hope so.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you all for the advice and love. It&#39;s been amazing and i&#39;m glad that through this experience I at least got some positive out of this mess. Will I come back? I don&#39;t know. If something happens and you guys still want an update i&#39;ll maybe come around again. But for now I&#39;m going to move on. For all those out there who shared their stories with me, thank you, and I hope to see you on the other side. See you space cowboy&#39;s :)

I dunno if theyre in a bad mood already and looking for someone to take it out on or what, but it&#39;s a lot... Like how sad so your have to be to be a grown-ass man taking your anger out on high school and college kids.

So James and I were joking about having a little fun with them and hopefully getting them off our backs.

So one day I was at work and some guy was having a temper about how we don&#39;t make the coffee hot enough... Which I couldn&#39;t do a thing about because I gave it to him right out of the machine.

So James came in and was like &quot;sir is there a problem here&quot; and the guy started ranting at him too. So he was just like &quot;OP, this is unacceptable, you&#39;re fired.&quot; 

I started acting real sad, like &quot;no please don&#39;t fire me, my family needs the money, I need this job, pleaseeee&quot; and he played up being a hard-ass, telling me to take off my apron and leave.

The angry guy started to backtrack, like &quot;It isn&#39;t that big of a problem, you don&#39;t need to fire her over it. I didn&#39;t mean it&quot; and James was like &quot;No, we pride ourselves on the best customer service&quot;

Of course after all that drama I still had my job, we were just acting. And we&#39;ve done it a couple times, whenever a customer will lose their temper at Danielle or I, James will storm in and &quot;fire&quot; us. And almost every time, the person who had come in angry will apologise and say that they didn&#39;t mean it. It&#39;s kind of satisfying, making people realize their actions might actually have consequences. 

Anyway, I was telling my friends from school about this and a few of them thought it was a mean prank, to let someone go away thinking they&#39;d gotten someone who desperately needs the money fired.

AITA for this joke?

✨Title✨
AITA for making a dad joke?
✨Text✨
Note. My step-daughter, Madeline, was about a year old when I married her mother, Jessica. Madeline’s father died before she was born. 
 
Madeline is currently 15, and she’s rebelling for almost everything. She did something bad, so while picking her up, I set a punishment up for her. Then she said “You’re not my dad. I don’t have to follow you”. Honestly, I got a bit hurt from that. But I understand that she didn’t mean it, and that she’d probably change. I just replied “I’m still your legal guardian for the next 3 years, and as long as your in my house, you have to follow my rules.” 
 
That happened about 2 days ago. So our family was going grocery shopping, when Madeline said “I’m hungry. I need food.” I decide to be extremely cheeky and say “Hi Hungry, I’m not your dad.” My son just started to laugh uncontrollably. My daughter was just quiet with embarrassment. And my wife was berating me “Not to stoop down to her level.” 
 
I honestly thought it was a funny dad joke. And my son agrees. So AITA?
 
Edit: I did adopt her. So legally I am her parent.

 
Mini Update: I’ll probably give a full update later but here is what happened so far. I go to my daughter’s room after dinner and begin talking with her. “Hey. I’m really sorry that I hurt you by the words I said. And I am really your dad. I changed your diapers, I met your boyfriend, and I plan on helping you through college. And plus I’m legally your dad, so we’re stuck together. But seriously, I’m going to love you like my daughter even if you don’t think I’m your dad. Then I hugged her. She did start to cry. I assume that’s good.

NTA. As a fellow baker fuck them. It&#39;s really annoying when you have a skill and family thinks they&#39;re entitled to the benefits of said skill. Had my brother&#39;s dad expect me to make a wedding cake for his daughter at one point. For free mind you.

Given you’re living at home and your mum and sister had to have been at least somewhat aware of the frequency of your baking (100 dishes in two years seems like roughly once a week... often enough to be noticeable) it’s really strange to me that they’re just deciding to be mad about this now. Surely if this was a real issue it could have been raised much earlier. NTA.

Aww I’m imagining a 14 year old baking and another 14 year old taking pictures and writing it all down. Warms my heart.

Your family definitely won’t appreciate your baking like your girlfriend does.

NTA, OMG OP. Dust that shit off. It&#39;s a couples thing they are just salty they didn&#39;t get treats, or an amazing scrap book (i bet no one will ever make them something so nice) 

Maybe if you wanted to make them some extra cookies that would be cool of you. That is a super sweet way for your GF to tell you that your efforts are appreciated. 

Some people feel entitled to the efforts of their family members (siblings, children) this is not so. If you had been drawing her art (they would be salty) if you had been writing her poetry, if you had been growing her flowers ect. 
My question is how  did they not notice Your new hobby? How much time do they spend asking after you? 

 Maybe if they paid any interest in your hobby they would have scored extra cookies.

I think what you’ve both done is a true representation of what love is. Your family on the other hand, the opposite. 

I’m sorry you’ve been made to feel guilty, but you have nothing to feel bad about. Please tell them to keep their opinions to themselves, and perhaps their reaction to it is exactly the reason why you don’t “do anything” for them in the first place.

Were there no signs, requests from your family or even a hint that they want to try some of your baking? You’re underage and likely live with your parents, meaning you’re using their kitchen... they had to have seen you baking... this seems like a very one sided story with not perspective offered from the other side...

I [16M] started dating my girlfriend 2 years ago. I also got super super into baking around that time. I bake a lot. My girlfriend loves desserts. So I&#39;ve given her a ton of stuff I bake, all kinds of different stuff. I often try to bake something new and then she gets to try something new. I honestly love baking way more than eating it. My girlfriend is the opposite.


Well recently she gave me a scrapbook she made. She had counted every thing I baked her apparently, and she gave me this scrapbook after I baked her, her 100th dessert. It was filled with a picture of every dessert I&#39;ve baked and pictures of me baking  and her eating. She wrote a paragraph about each item I baked. Each item was dated too. She had been working on this for 2 years. She also wrote a long letter on how proud she is of my baking hobby, thanking me for the sweets, and telling me how much she loves me. It was the sweetest gift I&#39;ve ever gotten and I honestly cried.


I showed my mom and sister expecting them to think its cute but they were pissed. They were angry I&#39;ve spent so much time baking for my girlfriend and not them. I just got into this habit and I loved making my girlfriend happy as well since she loves desserts.

ESH. Your girlfriend sounds super sweet and thoughtful, I love the idea of that gift. I don’t think your family was right in being pissed that you baked a lot for your gf and not really for them, but at the same time I see where they’re coming from. I get that you want to give everything to your gf as a form of appreciation, but surely you could’ve left some for your family as well. Obviously it shouldn’t be expected, but assuming you come from a good family (ignore this if not) that has done nice stuff for you/taken care of you, you should’ve considered if they’d want to try some too. They might be more hurt than mad that you decided to involve only your gf in your hobby and not them

It might be different if your family has asked you to bake for them before on some other occasions as a favor or something, but for them to just get mad at you out of nowhere is ridiculous. Your girlfriend’s gift was super thoughtful and cute :)

You’re never entitled to share your gifts with people you don’t want to. Your mom and sister shouldn’t act like you need to do that for them. If they said that they never realized you had such a knack for baking and then asked if they could try your creations at some point, that would have been alright. But to immediately try to guilt you to bake for them? Absolutely not. NTA. 

Also, your girlfriend sounds fantastic. To put together such a thoughtful gift that involved so much time and effort? You can’t even try to put a price on that. She’s awesome. You’re awesome.

Nta but you really should consider just making an extra serving for your family once in a while. Like yeah you have the autonomy to bake for whoever you want but isn&#39;t it kinda odd you never oncebaked for you family? Not for someone&#39;s birthday, mothers day, Father&#39;s day, or even just because? As a parent it probably would be dissapointing your children not only put their girlfriend or boyfriend first, but not even once included them in the hobby to any extent.

I’m gonna say NAH actually. I don’t think you’re intentionally ignoring them, but you’re 16. You live with your family, there’s probably a pretty good chance they’re providing for you, can you really blame them for being a little bit upset by the amount of work you’ve put in for your gf that you haven’t for them? I mean, I’m sure no one could expect you to make them 100 desserts but you live there, I’m assuming they’re making you dinner, surely you could... make dessert?

I don’t think you’re the asshole, you’re 16, this kinda thing doesn’t usually occur to teenagers, but I don’t think they’re the asshole for asking.

NTA, definitely.

But how did you bake 100 desserts for your girlfriend from age 14-16 without your family ever noticing that you bake a lot for her? Or did they just decide to be mad about it after you got a really nice gift? 

My family would have been copping cookies left and right, or at least getting involved (which might result in them getting some baked goods) if I were baking that much at home as a teen. 

If they don’t want to acknowledge your hobby at all for TWO YEARS then why would they expect to benefit from it?

Have you ever given your family any of these deserts you&#39;ve made? you don&#39;t answer that in the post. If you&#39;ve made 100 different deserts, and NEVER shared your baking with your family, despite making it with ingredients bought by your parents, in their house, then I&#39;d say Y T A a bit.

However, it is nice to appreciate family, that you do live with, and whose kitchen you are baking in. They reacted badly, and the timing of the complaint was bad.  I’m just going to assume your stuff looks and tastes awesome, so they are jealous. But maybe try to bake them something tasty now and then.

The fact you&#39;re 16 and they didn&#39;t know you&#39;ve been baking for 2 years says a lot about how interested they are in who you are as a person. If you were refusing your family when they asked I&#39;d maybe be closer to the fence, but 2 years at a hobby and they&#39;ve not even take the most basic of interest? Fuck &#39;em NTA.

As an aside, 2 years experience by the age of 16 is impressive to say the least, and when you combine that with the experimentation it&#39;s very impressive, if you haven&#39;t considered a career in the culinary arts maybe start considering it, when this is over try making contact with a local bakery/patissery and let them try your food, you can use your girlfriends gift as a portfolio displaying what you are able to make with photo and descriptive evidence to back it up. Keep at your art, particularly if you have a passion for it.

Nta but if the ingredients  your using to bake are payed for by your mom then it makes sence  that she might want some if the treats every once in awhile.  If you pay for all of the ingredients yourself  then your mom and sister  are in the wrong.

Soft YTA. 

Your a young person who lives at home under your mums roof. I’m going to presume pretty much everything you use is provided for by your mum. 
&amp; I mean house, electric/water,food,clothes etc. That takes her lots of effort to provide and maintain. 

You enjoy baking and often do so for your girlfriend. you’ve roughly dated 2yrs/104 weeks and you’ve baked for her at least 100 items, that’s one per week for two years only missing four weeks. 

If you don’t bake occasionally for your mum and family I can see why they are annoyed with you.

If you started this at 14 and were living at home, I assume the family were providing the ingredients, and you were also using their oven and utensils?
While that’s not grounds to expect you to bake on demand, it might be nice to show a bit of appreciation here.
I imagine when they seen the documented evidence of how much you had baked for your gf, that probably triggered the response.

When your mom saw the scrapbook, she should’ve said “hey you seem really talented, would you mind baking for us at some point?”

NTA, but I&#39;m genuinely amazed by the amount of people criticising kids for existing and forming interests. 

You bake - in *my* kitchen?
You read - sitting on *my* couch?
You paint - at the desk *I* bought?

Kids are not an investment. Just because there&#39;s &quot;nothing in for you&quot; doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s worthless or a sign of bad behaviour. They don&#39;t owe you. If you don&#39;t plan on spending money on your kids - money you&#39;ll never get back - there&#39;s a simple solution: don&#39;t have kids.

NTA i guess you dont have to bake anything for anyone esp if you buy the ingredients. But it depends on how many times you have baked for your family because I would find it kinda weird if my brother/son baked for his gf 100 times and never did it for the family he loves and lives with over 2 years. Given how much it meant to your gf you dont think your family would have really appreciated your baking as well?

It sounds like your girlfriend hasn&#39;t just enjoyed eating the desserts but also getting to share this journey with you and support you without involving herself too much so it&#39;s still yours. I&#39;m honestly so, so, impressed. Even more so considering how young you both are.

Not trying to justify it just saying that perhaps that will help you in the long run I dont think they are trying to be malicious instead they are expressing themselves in an unhealthy manner.

I think your mom and sis are just feeling very bitter because they likely haven’t had anyone put in this much effort for them. Seriously, you’ve been baking your GF something basically every week for two years. And your GF, how amazing!, secretly put together an incredibly thorough scrapbook celebrating a baking milestone between the two of you. I’m not surprised that inspired some jealousy, but I am surprised that they let it show that much.

NTA - (oh my gosh you and your girlfriend are so cute and wholesome!)

sorry to hear that your family is trying to guilt you into baking for them. In these kinds of scenarios, you gotta realize that hobbies like baking should be done only if you want to (that&#39;s what makes it a hobby!). People - even family - should not take it for granted or expect something from you just because it&#39;s an activity you enjoy doing. To do so would be taking advantage of you, and make your hobby no longer enjoyable. 

Why are you baking for your girlfriend? --&gt; because you love her and you want to do it; she is an appreciative party. 

Why don&#39;t you bake for your family? --&gt; because you don&#39;t want to.

It&#39;s as simple as that.

My kiddos and husband understand and they reap the benefits....they get the leveling pieces, cookies, tortes, all sorts of tastes and tries.

NTA. I love cooking. I am an accomplished home chef, but cooking (and baking) is a huge act of love for me. I only do it for my husband and child most of the time. I rarely do it for my parents or in-laws unless it is a birthday or something.

I have history with my parents. I have been cooking since I was 12 (35 years,)  And, they would criticize what I made when THEY asked me to cook.  They made fun of me for putting carrots in a lot of stuff (I love one dish meals, and at the time I loved carrots.) They raised me not to complain about any food you are given. You eat what was made and are grateful for it.  Yet, THEY constantly criticized the cooking of a teen who was learning. I stopped cooking for them much,  around the time I met my husband at age 21. Now, I am over age 45 and they beg for my food, but I have trouble making it for them.

My in-laws often think my food is too fancy, so we usually bring cookies or a boring church cookbook casserole to their house on holidays (we don&#39;t see them much, b/c they are kind of assholes, live far away, and never call us--yet get offended when we don&#39;t call or come see them. )

I guess my point is that cooking and baking are sometimes acts of love for people. We want people to appreciate our work and what we do, and if they don&#39;t, or we think they won&#39;t, we may not want to do it. You should never be forced to cook or bake for anyone. I truly believe there is a good reason that you don&#39;t want to bake for them. You may not know that reason consciously, but  deep down, you do know.

To keep the peace, how about making something special for them? Mother&#39;s Day is coming soon, so maybe make her one of her favorite desserts? Whatever you decide to do, don&#39;t let anyone take away the joy of baking - my sister is a pastry chef and comes up with the best desserts ever, so maybe you can also turn your passion for baking onto a career when you get older?

NTA. I know you’re only 16...but your gf sounds like a sweetheart. That is an amazingly thoughtful gift she gave you! 

Honestly, when I bake, my mom bitches about it, because like you, I don’t eat much of what I bake, so she thinks it’s a waste, kind of. I leave some of what I make at home, but the majority of it goes to work with me (I’m a CO, and my coworkers have been known to polish off 4 dozen cookies in 1.5 hours...we didn’t even make it to count time and they were gone lol), and I think unless some one specifically needs something for a bake sale, birthday or something like that, my mom sees it as wasteful, because the money for ingredients could’ve been saved or spent on a non-experiment. 

But don’t listen to them, especially if it’s your money going towards ingredients, you are cleaning up after yourself, and you’re not shirking other things in order to devote time to baking.

NTA it sounds like your girlfriend appreciates your effort and the time you spend on her. If your family’s immediate reaction is jealousy instead of being happy for you that you’re in such a loving relationship, they don’t deserve the sweets anyways.

NTA!! This is one of the most heartfelt things I have read in a while. You have found something that you enjoy to do, and your girlfriend has found a sweet way to support you, in a really thoughtful way! I love that she really dedicated herself this gift, just like you dedicated yourself to your interests. 
It’s hurtful that your family couldn’t be supportive. I’m sorry for that. That sucks. You are NTA.

NTA. at the same time, if you’re using THEIR utensils, THEIR ingredients, THEIR oven, it’s common decency to make them a little something so that you don’t get this privilege while you live at home stripped away. 

the difference between you and most of these commentators is that you are a minor living at home with your parents using their equipment. it’s great you’re practicing a skill and talent! 

but if you learned how to mow the lawn and took their lawnmower every weekend to your girlfriends house and never mowed the lawn at home that’d be weird right? yes, it’s still your time and effort that’s the gift, but if you’re using other peoples time, energy, money, possessions to do these things, you should pay back the favor in kind.

but you’re not an asshole, you’re a kid trying to do new things.

NTA - if anything, your family is the assholes for not appreciating you and your partner&#39;s relationship and your talent. From that reaction alone, they would probably mooch off of you constantly, if given the mere, tiny chance. So word of advice: don&#39;t bake for them. At all. Give them a millimeter, they&#39;ll try to take a whole damn kilometer, and then they would be a lot of conflict and the family would splinter like weak wood. So don&#39;t. Do what you love, and don&#39;t allow your family to taint it.

NTA. When you start working toward an adult relationship, your GF and eventually fiancee and wife, is supposed to come before your siblings and parents. If they (your mother and sister, going forward YMAS) feel this entitled to *all* the cool stuff you do, not just the thoughtful romantic stuff, then it&#39;s a sign they could have trouble letting go when you go to culinary school and become a successful pastry chef in Las Vegas or something equally wonderful. (But seriously, if you&#39;re enjoying it this much, business degree and/or culinary school might be a great career to start researching.) 

YMAS may not be constant attention-seekers jealous of your high school GF, and if that&#39;s the case then they may just be surprised by the scope and depth of the effort you put into the desserts when it&#39;s all condensed into an awesome scrapbook. It&#39;s hard to find guys who put in a lot of effort, especially at your age. Somewhere along the way someone was a good example to you of how to be a caring partner. It would just be weird if seeing that makes YMAS feel like they&#39;re entitled to all of your time and attention instead of your GF.

They handled it the wrong way. But I could see my family getting upset if they knew I made 100 desserts that they never got to try. Maybe save a few pieces for your family.

Your family should be proud and happy for you, even if they’re a little mad because you didn’t think to give some to your family, they shouldn’t say this.

Maybe save some snotty cupcakes for them in the future just to avoid further conflict, but as far as I’m concerned, you have done literally nothing wrong. 

You and your girlfriend sound cute as shut and I wish I had a man like you. I nearly cried when you talked about the scrap book. It’s amazing because it’s a memorialization of good things in a beautiful relationship between two beautiful people who care enough for each other to spend time telling each other that they care. Don’t let your family tale that way from you with greed. They don’t care about you in the situation, they want your deserts. 

(TL;DR) NTA, your girlfriend is great and your family did a mean thing.

NAH - I don&#39;t think you&#39;re an asshole at all for baking for your girlfriend, but I don&#39;t think your family is either. It seems like you must be baking things almost weekly, do you use your family&#39;s baking supplies that they bought? Do you ever think about baking anything for your family or is it always for your girlfriend? You can absolutely do what you want with what you bake, hence why I don&#39;t think you&#39;re the asshole, but it might be nice to make something for your family especially if you use ingredients they buy (which again IDK if you do, you could be buying them all on your own in which case I still think there are no assholes here). My brother is getting into baking and offers me stuff all the time, especially when it&#39;s something he knows I like. I would be hurt if he gave his girlfriend hundreds of baked goods and I never got one. I wouldn&#39;t think he&#39;s an asshole but I don&#39;t think I would be an asshole for feeling hurt either, so again I think there are no assholes here.

It is only natural that your SO or room mates or whoever get to taste your creations on a more regular basis than your family if they don&#39;t even live under the same roof as you.

If you want to be sweet, maybe you can have a get together once or twice a month when the plague is over and they get to eat some of your baked goods in the future.

I think they only saw the amount of pastries and such you have made and didn&#39;t think that this was over a longer period of time (2 years as you said). You didn&#39;t have a secret party and neglect to invite them where you ate 100 desserts in one sitting. Maybe it was a gut reaction, how do they normally react on things they have missed or weren&#39;t invited too?

This is just too sweet (literally!).

However, do be cognizant of the fact that you&#39;re (probably) using food/ingredients that your parents have provided. If you&#39;ve made at least 100 desserts, I can&#39;t tell you how much money that even is. It&#39;s a lot, and I could see myself being annoyed if the stuff I was working so hard to provide for my family was going straight out the door. However, if you&#39;ve been buying all that stuff yourself, kudos!

When husband and I were living with my parents I made cookies to bring as gifts to my husband&#39;s family Xmas party, was going to package them in pretty winter themed boxes and everything. I took the nicest looking cookies for the gifts and was going to leave the rest for myself and my parents. My mom got annoyed/mad that I was keeping the not so nice cookies for my parents. WTF. Apparently I was supposed to package the broken cookies as gifts. And it&#39;s not like I couldn&#39;t have made more. But that behavior didn&#39;t really make me want to. Some people are completely oblivious to their own behavior.

NTA!! God your family sounds entitled AF. If they want it so badly, why don’t they bake WITH you? Maybe they could learn how to do it for themselves and stop bitching. 

I want to make it clear to anyone reading: you don’t really owe your parents anything. Don’t let them guilt you. Just because they fed and clothed you—which is literally the bare minimum—doesn’t mean you have an obligation to care for toxic people. They chose to have a child—you; you did not choose to be born into a f*cked up world filled to the brim with suffering. You are their responsibility. They are not yours. 

If you have great, emotionally healthy parents who you love, go for it. But as someone who was guilted my entire life simply for being myself, I am DONE believing that I owe them for making me miserable and mentally ill.

I don’t know, it’s really cute you bake so much for your girlfriend and it’s even better that she appreciates it and made the scrapbook.

But I’m coming from a very loving and close family. I bake for everyone I love and care about. If I wouldn’t do it for my parents, my siblings but I’d do it for my boyfriend...that just seems very weird. That I don’t appreciate them or care for them or that I put my bf before them (what would never happen). So if they’re disappointed to not get anything from you although they raised and care about you - I fully understand that. And if you have to tell someone „oh it would be nice to get a dessert from you someday too“ than that’s weird to. The person should remember before them telling you...I mean you stated you do it because you see it makes your gf happy and you want her to be happy.

If you on the other hand don’t have a close relationship with your family then it’s fine, nothing to think about. Let them be mad, not your problem.

NTA. And I know there’s not a lot here about your family, but do they have healthy boundaries and attitudes? Because this has several worrisome points—
1) They chose to address their grievances in response to an AMAZING LOVE GIFT from your girlfriend, rather than, say, and other time in the past throw years you have baked?
2) Let’s say their feelings were just hurt, hurt feelings sometimes get expressed as anger. Healthy would discuss again when everyone was calm, apologize for anger and the. Express the actual need. The fact that you are feeling GUILT in this scenario sounds more like manipulation. 
3) A kid who does something as time consuming and thoughtful, consistently for two years, is probably doing thoughtful things at home too , so this feels more like jealousy which is again NOT OK. 

This sounds so much like something my mom would do. (She has borderline personality) She was always threatening anything nice I did for others— even if I did nice things for her too. She was also threatened by my love for anyone not her. And anyone’s love for me was suspicious.

I have a kid now, and I would think my kid showing that sort of love, and it being reciprocated so beautifully, would be AMAZING. I would be happy for them. 

If I felt excluded I would talk about it at a different moment. 

If I was SoO HURT I responded with bitterness, I would address it once I calmed down — within 24 hours. 

Basically, you shouldn’t feel guilty. If you have been “neglecting” your family, that doesn’t mean what you did for your girlfriend was wrong. Or that their response was correct. It was just a need that could be expressed and addressed without guilt. Or shame. 

Keep being so giving!

I&#39;m going with a hard NTA here, but I would like to say that this might also have something to do with the amount of time you spend with her. There&#39;s nothing wrong with spending a ton of time with your girlfriend, but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that it sucks to miss someone, especially if it&#39;s a family member you&#39;ve never had to put effort into your relationship with before. If this is all true, it&#39;s still their fault for not managing their own emotions (especially your mom) but it might be nice for all of you if you try to increase the *quality* of the time you spend together

NAH.  I have two teenage kids, so I understand how your mom feels. Moms love it when their kids share their interests and passions, especially teenagers. It’s jarring when your little boy grows up and doesn’t want to have anything to do with you anymore. 


You’ve found your passion and it’s amazing. Instead of sharing your passion with your mom, you’ve chosen to share your girlfriend’s reaction to your passion. 


You’re basically saying “I love baking but I don’t want to share that with you. Look at how much this other person loves it, though.”


You’re 16 and obviously a sweet boy. You are not an asshole, but when it comes to sharing your passion, you’re in the wrong here.

That’s so sweet of your girlfriend and she makes you happy and appreciated.

“Thank you” goes a long way. 

If anything your sis and mom should have been happy for you.

Hey OP, so happy for you for the love you have for baking and the wonderful relationship you have with your girlfriend! 

If you’ve been baking for two years, this couldn’t have been the first time your mom or sister spoke to you about baking, how did it go earlier? Did you learn to bake from your mom or ever bake with them? Did they ever request to try any of your stuff? Did you ever bake for the family? Birthdays, Easter, anything?

They should have reacted differently but maybe they just feel left out... talk to them. NAH I think.

Of all the ways they could have reacted, they decided to be angry about it... or should I say salty?

In any case, point out that to them that you expect an apology from them. This is a hobby you do for fun, not freebies for everyone to grabs. If they refuse to apologize for their entitled and rude attitude, tell them that you would have being willing to let them have a taste of your bakery if they had being nice about it but that from now on, it will stay a special activity between you and your wife.

Make sure to add puns in there while you are at it, about flavor (sweet, sour, salty, etc) LOL

If you decide to be more flexible, make sure to not let everyone be entitled to your cooking though. Trust me, they will. They sound very entitled and will probably try to guilt-trip you to get free stuff or make you their personnal baker.

Her response really put our relationship into perspective, nothing about my life is worth her celebrating but if she can gain something from me she feels entitled to take it.

NTA but I&#39;m going to go against the grain and say I do understand your mom and sister&#39;s feelings. It&#39;s clear that baking is a form of showing your affection. If my brother baked every week to show his girlfriend he cares and never (or rarely) baked for the family, I&#39;d feel a little... hurt. I&#39;d be thinking, &quot;if this is a form of showing he cares, why hasn&#39;t he made that gesture to me?&quot; Maybe you have different ways of doing that for your family.

But maybe that&#39;s not it. Maybe they&#39;re just jealous/petty. 

Either way, you&#39;re not an AH. It&#39;s incredibly sweet what you&#39;ve done for your gf.

NTA. First if all, who is your GF, Leslie Knope?

Second, if it&#39;s your skill, time, and ingredients then you can do whatever you want with them. If your mom has bought all the ingredients, then I kind of see her being a little frustrated, but only a little.

If you want to be TA, you could &quot;experiment&quot; with new baked goods or recipes &quot;so that you can make more for your GF&quot;. Just add too much or not enough of specific ingredients where it looks like you&#39;re trying to be nice, but actually giving them subpar.

I am going against the flow here and point out something: How many times has your mom cooked for you yet she is not good enough to get one of your baking goods every now and then. It&#39;s seems ungrateful to me. It wouldn&#39;t kill you to do something for your family once a month... Sharing is caring, just saying. ESH

NTA. This is such a beautiful gift. It&#39;s incredibly thoughtful. Share pictures if you feel comfortable doing so! Anyway, in regards to my judgment: your girlfriend has proven to be extremely grateful of your treats, and she has helped you cultivate something you love so much. I&#39;m sure if you ever felt like not baking for a while, she wouldn&#39;t mind. Your family however, seems to think they are owed something, when this is absolutely not the case. If you feel like defending your point, tell your mother and sister that they haven&#39;t showed as much gratitude as you would like them to.

Doing what you’re doing for your girlfriend is super sweet (literally), and her scrapbook ever sweeter, I’m happy for you two. 

Now, I don’t know if you were using your own ingredients (ones you purchase), but if you did repeatedly take ingredients from your household simply to give to your gf, then it’s understandable that your parents are pissed for them paying for baking ingredients that you use to give to your girlfriend, and not so much for them. I’m sure if you did bake more for them there would be no issue; I don’t think this makes you an asshole!

NTA, what a weird reaction to something so sweet.  There are 52 weeks in a year, so you baked for her roughly once a week, that’s so thoughtful.  Your girlfriend created a beautiful thank you gift as well.  You two are lucky to have one another... 

In response to your family, 

Of course it would be thoughtful to do it for your family as well.  I bake for my family for fun some days...  I also will sometimes bake extra because I’m often using their ingredients and appliances and they would do the same for me.  I mean no one should be required to bake for others. 


Their reaction is really unfortunate, I’m sorry that happened.

NTA. I like cake decorating and like to try out different flavor combinations and do it as a hobby (as my joints allow). It&#39;s a known thing that I play around with it and will occasionally make birthday cakes for friends and have made a couple of wedding cakes. People will 100%take for granted that I have the time, energy and desire to make them a cake for free just because we know each other. I had one person want me to make the same cake set up (flavor and cake/cupcake combo) for their wedding that I had at mine and they asked this right after what would have been my first anniversary had my husband not died a couple months before. There have been a number of times that people have said I could make my own birthday cake. There are even more times that I&#39;ve just been full on voluntold that I was making the cake for some event.  

People don&#39;t understand the work that goes into stuff like that. They don&#39;t understand the time, the energy, or the cost. People think that it&#39;s just something you slap together in the hour after the cake comes out of the oven. I have learned not to bake for the people who refuse to acknowledge my efforts or think they are somehow entitled to the products of my efforts - especially for free.

In any case, baking is AWESOME and you have a lot to be proud of. Maybe your mom and sis just feel hurt and left out? Maybe bake them something special to get back on the same page. They probably love you too and just want to be part of the fun. Their reaction sucked but it probably came hurt, so try to be forgiving.

NTA, OP!! You sound like a really sweet wonderful boyfriend/girlfriend (I either didn’t notice or didn’t see if you specified your gender and don’t want to assume). Your family is upset over a non-issue. There’s no reason for them to be so salty over something so small. Baking is something you enjoy sharing with your girlfriend. Your family thinking that you have to do the same things for them that you do for your girlfriend is irrational. You wouldn’t buy your mom and sister a dozen roses, chocolates, and a fancy dinner for Valentine’s Day. If your mom had said something along the lines of “why don’t you bake me desserts??” and said it playfully/teasingly that would be one thing. But to be genuinely mad about it? It’s a little ridiculous. 

Again, NTA.

NTA - your family sounds like jealous assholes.

The fact that your GF took the time to review each individual baking scenario and then compile a scrapbook is incredibly endearing.  That’s some potential marriage level stuff right there.  

Stop to think for yourself:  how do you really feel about your GF?  How do you really feel about your family?  How do you envision the two enmeshing?  If your GF pisses your family off how are you going to handle it?  If your family pisses off your GF, how are you going to handle it?

Best of luck navigating this potential quagmire, but typically a policy of honesty and transparency is best - both with your GF and with your family.

The two are certainly not mutually exclusive but how you handle potential pitfalls WILL be noticed by both your family and your GF.

I&#39;m in a similar situation. I love baking. But I only do so when I actually feel like it. I&#39;ve been busy, so I don&#39;t bake as often. The times I have baked, I&#39;ve made cookies and cake for my friends, and their birthdays. My family always demands that I make something for them. Had they requested it politely, I would&#39;ve done it. But they never put my feelings into consideration, and expect me to give them everything I have, on command. They get upset with me that I would rather bake for &quot;those people&quot; (I have friends of mixed races) instead of my own flesh and blood. My mother especially loves it when I bake sweets because she goes out of her way to announce to everyone in our family and her circle of friends that I can bake, and that I&#39;m taking requests, without even asking me first. She doesn&#39;t do it because she&#39;s proud of me, she does it because she has always been highly competitive, and narcissistic when it comes to shit like sibling rivalry. I enjoy baking as a hobby. It stops being enjoyable once I feel like I&#39;m being forced to do it. (Which has happened before.)

To me it sounds like your family is more greedy than appreciative.  The point of a hobby is to have fun doing something you love, and if my family pressured me to bake for them like that it’d feel more like a chore than a hobby.  You aren’t obligated to bake for anybody, and don’t let them make you think otherwise.

Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but at your age your family is doing more for you than your girlfriend is. Unless they gave you trauma or something, why wouldn&#39;t you love your family the same as your girlfriend?

Don’t stop baking, but next time, for them, purposely bake something nasty and when they get that look that you get when you taste something awful, tell them that’s how their reaction to your girlfriend’s sweet gift made you feel.

NTA. You dont have to make anything for anyone you dont want to. Family or not. If they really wanted some, all they had to do was ask nicely and respectfully.

I used to bake my friends cupcakes for their birthdays instead of getting them gifts. That was 1 box of cake mix and 1 can of icing. My family isn&#39;t all that big on sweets and desserts but whenever I baked they would obviously smell it and want some. If my mom or my brother wanted a cupcake or whatver I had baked, all they had to do was ask and they could take whatever they wanted. 

If they enjoyed something I made they would ask if I could bake more and I would. But they ASKED. It wasn&#39;t like they were entitled to it. 

You keep doing you, OP. You don&#39;t owe them anything. If they want something, they can ask for it... nicely.

Also, your girlfriend sounds like the sweetest, most thoughtful human ever. She obviously really appreciates what you do for her and the scrapbook is such a great gift to show you how much she appreciates you.

NTA. That’s a seriously adorable present. You two are sweet.

I want to add, though, that even though your mother and sister are being petty and rude, I can kind of get it. You’re 16, which typically means that the tools and ingredients and oven you are working with have been provided by your folks. A little bit of loving labor in return would be super nice. That doesn’t change that they were wrong.

Just consider being the charitable one.

Wow, NTA, what you and your girlfriend have is sweet. Sometimes women get jealous of the males in their lives when they show &quot;other&quot; women attention or love, this often stems from being insecure in their position in said males life. Don&#39;t take it too personally as it&#39;s got nothing to do with you and you can&#39;t fix it, your mum has the problem and passed it onto your sister.

Have people lost the capacity to suppress feelings of jealousy, to express gladness for someone else getting something nice, without needing to lash out because they didn&#39;t get it?  


Would they have made a baking scrapbook to celebrate your baking skills?  


Oh, don&#39;t get me wrong, I think you could bake enough to share with the whole class.  But you&#39;ve done something romantic for GF and were gifted in turn with something romantic.  It&#39;s a refreshing treat for us after the usual stuff we have to see on AITA.   


Good luck in the future.  If you can bake at 14, you can do just about anything you please later in life.  Chemical engineering, nuclear medicine, you name it.  Or just...bake!

Your mom and sister sound very selfish and bitter, they should have been happy for you.  A more appropriate response to you would have been &quot;Wow that&#39;s so nice!  Would you mind baking/sharing some for us too?&quot;  Definitely don&#39;t stop this lovely hobby because of them, you did nothing wrong.  If your mom starts to be nasty towards your GF in the future out of jealousy, I&#39;d recommend lurking in r/JUSTNOMIL or r/raisedbynarcissists so you&#39;re prepared to lay down some boundaries.

I kind of get where they&#39;re coming from as my family is the same way. Feeding people is a form of love so your actions are telling your family you love your gf but not them. Have you ever baked for your family? Baking 100 things to impress a girl but nothing for your own mother is a little thoughtless and harsh. Also, do you purchase all of your own ingredients when you bake or do you use what&#39;s in your mother&#39;s kitchen that she bought for the family? 

Now, this is typical behavior for many young men to put 100%into a romantic relationship while giving zero effort into the rest of his relationships. But it shows a lack of emotional intelligence and a failure to be considerate of those around you as you are probably taking those relationships for granted. The reality is you&#39;re probably going to break up at some point but your mom and sister will still be your family. I&#39;ve seen this happen with a handful of people and they lead very lonely lives now. Ex girlfriends make for terrible friends/ support systems as the motivation to invest in you drops dramatically after the spark is gone. 

Not enough info,  possibly yta for neglecting the relationships that are likely to last longer.

Gotta have the taste testers haha, plus my mom would usually be nearby in the living room, or kitchen so having her around watching me and not letting her try it wouldn’t feel right by me! Then again, don’t know your family dynamics but it does seem strange that you wouldn’t share! either way, that was a cool present your gf gave you, very nice of her.

What you do for your girlfriend is wonderful and what she did for you in return is equally as wonderful. 

As for your mom and sister, I want to try and offer a possible view from their side. I have a brother a little older than you that just got a girlfriend a little while ago and while he won’t do nearly anything we ask him to do (help with dishes and such) he will do whatever his girlfriend asks.

I’m not saying this is you since I can’t be sure but perhaps the fact you bake for her to that extent makes them upset since you would not do that for them?

Your relationship will always be different between your sister and mom and your girlfriend, but try making a little extra for them every once in a while. I think it’s just overall a nice thing to do and it would make everyone happy. Again, I’ll assume that your mom and sister do nice things for you and are decent, I feel like making a larger batch isn’t usually too tough, you don’t need to do it all the time either.

Personally whenever I bake I always just make a batch that is enough for everyone to have a taste along with whoever I’m making it for. Like cookies, double the recipe, you know? 

I think they just feel as though maybe you don’t love them since one of them raised you and the other grew up with you and they haven’t been shown similar appreciation?

I think it always happens when you date, the parents on either end feel as though their child gives their significant other more attention and care, they feel as though it’s unfair because they knew you first and did things for you first. That’s normal and alright so long as you don’t completely neglect your family and not show them any appreciation ever ya know?

NAH - it’s a courtesy thing. Your post implies the only baking you ever do is for your gf. Assuming if you still live with your parents they make you dinner, the least you can do to show your appreciation is to let them try some of the food you make. No, you’re not OBLIGED to, but it’s rather inconsiderate not to. The other aspect of this missing is that baking is not usually something that only results in one or two items- where are the rest going? Is she taking all of them? Are you hoarding them in your room? All I’m saying is it’s really not that hard to let them sample it. For those saying they should have asked, some people come from guess culture where that’s considered rude. I can see why they’d be at least annoyed when it’s being displayed outright the high volume of food and love you’ve been giving/showing her over the last 2 years and they haven’t seen ANY of it.

I used to bake for my family all the time until they started requesting me to bake for every birthday and holiday (I have a lot of siblings). The frustration was real so I stopped for a long time. When I met my bf and started baking for him, his enjoyment and appreciation made everything feel worthwhile and really made me excited to get back into the kitchen and create new things.

NTA, and that gift sounds so sweet, it’s like she saved the sugary essence of all your prior works and condensed it into one book. 



I think your family was lashing out because they may not see the signs that you love them as well, sort of like how people in a family get used to a family member asking how they’re doing in a sign of affection, but then get mad when they overhear the person asking after another outside the family. Well, that’s extrapolating beyond the situation you’ve described, but that’s just my two cents. Maybe just have a sit down with them to say that you do care for both your gf and your family, assuming they’re the type who would listen.

Wtf. Way to be encouraging of you for learning a lifelong skill and engaging in a fulfilling hobby with someone you love! Congrats, man, baking can take you a lot of places in this world.

Now, I take it you&#39;re doing most of this baking at your house where your family lives with you. Have they ever expressed interest in your hobby as you were doing all this baking? Have they noticed your work and requested sweets for home? Maybe they have been interested and just haven&#39;t been direct enough... And if you&#39;re using your family kitchen, dishes, and/or ingredients purchased by mom, then the considerate thing to do is to pay a little dessert tax to the fam for the privilege, regardless of whether or not they ask you for it. Maybe all that baking that they constantly smell has been building up the resentment and they haven&#39;t wanted to say anything until now. However, you&#39;re 16, and life is a learning experience.

To summarize: they didn&#39;t handle it great, they could&#39;ve shown interest in your hobby more directly if the tasty smells were driving them nuts. But also, as a family member using shared space and shared equipment, it would be more considerate to sometimes leave some baking that&#39;s for the household. But that&#39;s a lesson in etiquette that occurs to very few young people, and you had your focus on the very utilitarian matter of having this special thing that you and your gf share. There was room here for more kindly worded instruction on the matter.

Edit to add... I&#39;m changing my ruling on this one, it&#39;s such a squeaker for me that I&#39;m requesting INFO:

1. Who&#39;s been purchasing all your baking ingredients? I mean both special ingredients and pantry staples, if your family keeps a stocked pantry that you&#39;re making extensive use of, that&#39;s a factor. If you were out there at 14 spending your money from odd jobs on flour and sugar, bravo, my dude!
2. Where/when is the baking happening? How often is your family kitchen tied up with this baking (regardless of whether or not others seemed like they wanted to use it, cause you never know what others have going on)? It sounds like an average of once a week that you&#39;re regularly baking up a storm?
3. Please please OP tell me that you&#39;re cleaning up all your dishes (and the kitchen) when you bake. And I mean all of them. Within 24 hrs of finishing, but hopefully less than that. Yes?

It&#39;s with these in mind that I&#39;m inclined to go easy on your family for being (admittedly) rude... But if you&#39;re being a good and responsible baker, then I rule in your favor.

Don’t let the hatred of your family get you down or make you like baking any less. Offer your family some sweets as well from now on by making a bigger batch, and if they’re still salty, then fuck em.

I&#39;m so glad your girlfriend obviously appreciates it. Ignore your family&#39;s bitterness. (I know that&#39;s hard.)

Don&#39;t know how dead this thread is, but I&#39;m gonna risk going against the grain and say YTA.

Reddit has such an obsession with putting parents on the highest pedestal and demonizing them when they&#39;re not the perfect emotionless shell that they think they should be.

Your mom is completely allowed to be upset by that, the thing that makes it good or bad is how she deals with that upset. If you said that she took away all your baking ingredients or forced you to break up with your girlfriend over this? I&#39;d 100% be on your side. But from what I&#39;m understanding from your post, she voiced her upset, which isn&#39;t a bad thing, everyone has emotions.

A big argument I see is &quot;well if it was a problem she should&#39;ve said it before.&quot; I disagree with that. 100 desserts over two years might not be a lot, true. Maybe they didn&#39;t think it was that much either, I&#39;m sure OP is home alone at times. But I think they got hurt when they realized how many you made for your girlfriend (which is very sweet by the way) without ever offering once, and I understand their upset. Being told 100 in 2 years vs being shown 100 has a different impact.

So yeah, OP, I think you could&#39;ve shared without them having to ask. I&#39;m not saying make them a whole cake, bit I&#39;m sure your girlfriend would&#39;ve been as happy with 10 cookies than she was with 12. Parents are allowed to show emotions, once again, it&#39;s how they show it that matters.

NTA. If you&#39;re buying your own ingredients and your family has never actually asked you nicely (as opposed to just demanding) to bake them something then you are not the asshole for not baking for them. 

I bake for my family all the time and drop stuff off to them.. mostly because I practice and practice and practice until I get it right and need people to eat what I&#39;ve made. But they would never get bent out of shape if I stopped or didn&#39;t make them something I&#39;d been trying to master. If they wanted something, they would definitely ask me if I could do it and probably offer to purchase the ingredients as well. 

You sound like a dude who has his heart in the right place and good on you for teaching yourself a solid skill.

I&#39;m going with NTA, but your family may be upset that you&#39;re spending the ingredients they bought for someone else. I know that sounds super petty, but I grew up pretty poor, so using ingredients all the time for someone outside of the family and never for the family would have gotten me in a lot of trouble. Now if you&#39;re spending your allowance or working for the money to buy the ingredients yourself, they have no place being upset at you for using your money for something you love to do

It was  filled with a picture of every dessert I&#39;ve baked and pictures of me  baking  and her eating. She wrote a paragraph about each item I baked.  Each item was dated too. She had been working on this for 2 years. She  also wrote a long letter on how proud she is of my baking hobby,  thanking me for the sweets, and telling me how much she loves me. It was  the sweetest gift I&#39;ve ever gotten and I honestly cried.&quot;*

It seems like baking is one of the ways you express love, so ig your family felt like you didn’t prioritize them in your affections as much as you did ur gf. Especially if you haven’t baked for them at  all. I think it is less about them feeling entitled to ur food, and more about them feeling excluded from your thoughtfulness.  But I think that you didn’t do it on purpose and that baking was more of a thing between you and your gf, rather than you and everyone you have a relationship with. Just make it clear that in your mind, baking was a romantic thing and you didn’t mean to exclude them. Obviously my interpretation would be different if they were demanding and mean, rather than hurt and confused. Also, fun hobby and great gf!

I think people are missing the point. It&#39;s not about the food, it&#39;s about the fact that he &quot;spent so much time baking for his girlfriend&quot;. The family is being petty because they don&#39;t feel special. OP, you keep doing what you&#39;re doing. If they wanted some, they should ask or make some themselves. If they can&#39;t even do that then it&#39;s clear they just want the attention your girlfriend got and not the food. Family shouldn&#39;t be entitled to niceties especially if they can&#39;t share in your happiness or be happy for you.

What an incredible gift from your girlfriend! 

I have this funny theory that whenever I bake or cook, I have to be in a good mood and really care about the person I&#39;m making it for. I used to make these really great cookies whenever I was happy or in love, and I remember my mom telling me I *had* to make them once for a family event. I didn&#39;t feel like it, and even though I put the same ingredients in, the cookies just didn&#39;t taste very good in the end. I think your desserts for your girlfriend are probably that much better for how happy they make her and you, and that desserts made for your sister and mother might end up as bitter as they are being.

I think it might be worthwhile to sit them down and say that you would like to talk more about what happened. Clearly, this baking thing has been bothering them for a while, but you were very hurt by their behavior. Either way you are SO not an asshole for baking for your girlfriend. Just because you bake doens&#39;t mean everyone else is entitled to it (although if your mom pays for ingredients it might be nice to have a couple set aside for them too! Maybe that&#39;s where this is coming from?)

a propitiate reaction would be that they are happy for you, proud of you and show enthusiasm for your baking hobby and then impressed asking if they could taste something you have baked too. NTA 

their reaction just shows me one more reason why you bake for your girlfriend and not for them, they behave egoistic and obviously your girlfriend is grateful.

NTA - its okay if you do enjoy cooking to her and only her. I LOVE to cook, im not very good at it, but i still try my best to make my family happy with my food, but they usually just... Ignore it... It hurts a little so i just cook less and less, but one time i cook for a cousin and she enjoyed it so much and make me so happy. Probably its kinda the same with you, yo cook for her because she shows you she love it, and you Probably love feeling that gratitude, and, of course, if your family is pissed of for something as stupid like &quot;WhY dIdnT yOu cOoK foR uS?!&quot; you would probably dont want to cook for them, as they are kinda trying to force you to make something for them. You wouldn&#39;t enjoy cooking for them, so you wouldn&#39;t care feeling their gratitude as you didnt want to give your food to them at the end. Something like when in christmass you have to give something to your annoying little cousin because otherwise your aunt would be angry at you. Your cousin looks happy, but you dont care at all, you didn&#39;t want to make him happy.

I hope that you understand what im trying to say, im not a native speaker, im sorry if you notice something is off.

You&#39;re definitely not the asshole! I (20F) love baking too AND me and my partner (26M) agreed that this is the sweetest thing ever!

NTA. I always find it sad when family and partners feel like they have to compete against each other. Baking is something you love to do, you owe nothing to anyone. I understand they were probably sad, but conflict is not the way to go. You have right to spend time with someone outside of your family.

NTA however is there a bigger picture here where you could be making more of an effort in other ways for them that you don’t? The reason I (F29) am asking is because my brother (32) goes way over and beyond for his gf - booking surprise holidays to Disneyland (we live in Europe so that’s pretty expensive as a gift and he wouldn’t have a lot of disposable income), he calls me and my mum to get ideas for presents for her at Xmas and her birthday, gives her lifts (I think Americans call it rides) anytime she wants and spends every spare moment he has with her.. which is great for them but he makes zero effort with me or my mum and when we rarely see him all he talks about is her and her family, what her opinions are about whatever the topic of conversation is.. basically she is his whole world.

He would never call me to ask me how I am or instigate any form of communication other than when he has a problem or needs advice e.g. both of his previous break ups. I honestly don’t mind because I’m busy and am very happy in my own life. I have just kind of accepted that’s the way he is. He can also be pretty insensitive (says things without thinking) but I just laugh it off. 

My mum on the other hand has been through a lot - she was very ill for a few years and I had to remind him to contact her and ask her how she is / if he can do anything for her because she told me he doesn’t seem to care that she’s even in hospital (this was a few years ago). I have to text him to remind him of Mother’s Day and her birthday every year. My parents every few months pass a comment about him not making any effort with them other than when he contacts them when he needs something like a tax form, birth cert, career advice. Neither of us live at home for years and he never calls over to say hi or have dinner with them. He’s very babyish in a lot of ways, he finds it very hard to read signals from people, to empathise with someone or to consider others feelings.. not in a horrible way, they just don’t click for him.. hence why I never take things personally. 

My point is because of all of this my mum gets quite upset that he can seem to do all of the nice gestures for a girlfriend and seems to forget about his own family. I know she said last xmas she didn’t want to know about his girlfriends present when he was going on and on about it. He was very confused by this because he just doesn’t get the bigger picture and it wasn’t really about her Xmas present... so it might not be about the baking? I’ve no idea what your relationship is like with your family but that’s my side of one situation as a sister, hope it helps. 

I will say both of my parents are absolutely amazing, a great team, so loving. They have instilled really good morals in us all and have always put us before any of their needs and wants. They poured money into any extra classes we needed grinds in as kids - sports, dancing classes, music lessons.. anything we wanted (except materialistic things we didn’t need so we were not spoilt in that way) while cutting back on themselves to afford this. They really showed us how to work hard, earn our keep and have given us amazing life skills so there’s no reason for my brother to be like this, he just is the way he is.

ESH ... MAYBE. I love to bake, and in high school I would bake all the time! but rarely for my family.  And it would make my mom (and brothers) sad that of all the time spent together the meals, snacks, birthdays etc, I wouldn&#39;t ALSO show my love to them via baking.

However, i might be missing some information.  Out of the 12 cupcakes made, were they all for your GF? or did you leave half on the counter for your family? If you made 2 loaves of banana bread did you leave one with mom and sisters name on it?  Maybe you did, and then... I don&#39;t know why they would be mad! But... maybe you didn&#39;t and they felt deeply excluded (especially parents who have given a lot since birth)

YTA ish imo. Maybe it’s a cultural thing but I would have had my ass handed back to me to oblivion and back if I did what you did to my family. Out of all the times you were baking, you couldn’t just spend the extra few effort to add an extra batch for the family? Who puts a roof over your head and provides you a meal everyday? And think about any other time your family has helped you in anything. IMO it’s just basic courtesy to look out for your family at least once in a while.

Finding that in a partner is pure gold. If your own family isn&#39;t twice as happy for you . . . .fuck them. No cookies for them. You bake for your girlfriend because you are inspired to do so. if your Mom and Sister don&#39;t inspire that in you. That&#39;s on them, not you. Bake in  peace and happiness. It is your art. You make art for you. No one else. You decide and you rock on wit your bad self!

Not involved but to put in perspective how weird that is When I was a freshman I dated this kid (I apparently went to preschool with him), and then I didn’t have school with him until high school. I low key was only interested in him Bc my mom mentioned that, but he was also like in that mid point of not popular but not unpopular. Mostly Bc he was smart but not cocky and communicative but introverted (open but quiet?). I ended up getting a complex Bc he liked having a gf but didn’t like the attention or the personal involvement involved in a relationship, and I couldn’t comprehend that. So for his birthday I baked him rubix cube cookies.it was in an angle where you’re looking from a corner and can see 3 sides of the cube at an angle, and I icing decorated as such. It took until 3:20 am to finish, with my moms help, and when I took it to him the next day, he said ‘thanks! These look cool.’ And shut the door. Also not to mention we were 2 streets over, so I walked up this big ass hill alone to receive said message. Anyways the parents/ older brother never said anything to me, but I learned years later his mom sent my mom a Facebook message saying she thought the cookies were rly well done. Through the entire relationship she never commented on me giving to her, or etc. just tried to keep the preschool mom bonding Alive. (Also we good now we went to prom together senior year platonically and are good friends)

Tbh it sounds as if your mum and sister are feeling left out and maybe feeling as though you care more for your gf than them. Even if this is the case they should keep this to themselves, especially when you&#39;re showing them something that you&#39;re happy about. That was a bad move by them. They may also feel as if she is stealing you from them. Of course i dont know anything about the nature of your relationship between you and your mum, sis but it sounds like your gf is really kind and thoughtful. If it comes between her and your family, i would choose her. You can always make up with your family if you want to, but if you push her away i doubt she will come back

NTA regardless of all the baking related stuff. it’s devastating to show a family member anything you are excited about, proud of, or looking forward to - and to be shut down and humiliated like you did something wrong. that generates guilt and reluctance to ever share again, so, yeah, they are the a-holes. reactions like that, especially from family is what creates small cracks in relationships that eventually make the whole thing crumble... been there. you keep baking and hope your gf keeps eating it too! seems like you guys have a sweet thing going on~ that amount of hard work is indicative of real love

No you’re not. Congratulations on having someone so nice in your life (i avoided the ”sweet” pun there). That sounds like an amazing gift to receive and you deserve to feel good about it. 

That said, I’m sure your mom and sister care about you so maybe talk to them about how their reaction made you feel ... over a cake you baked. They probably didn’t realize they came of as pissed or bitter. Maybe they just want a taste. Baking and cooking can often be a way of showing you care (as you know), so show them you care. 

But DON’T think that their reaction was right, they should have expressed happiness for you (my opinion) but sometimes we all make mistakes in our reactions and emotional responses. Bake a peace offering and say thank you for them being in your life while also letting them know what the gift meant to you. 

Sorry, point is keep baking for those you care about.

ESH - Here goes my first comment on this sub... In a perfect world your family would suck for not being supportive of you in this scenario. However, we live in an imperfect world where everybody has feelings be they rational or irrational.

You&#39;re 16 which means you are pretty attached to your family, you live with them, eat with them, probably do a lot of things together. Look at this from their perspective, how could this person not share this activity which gives them so much joy with us? They&#39;re jealous, right or not its what it is and you should be mindful of their feelings in this situation.

One thing I rarely see when I read stories on this sub are the actions you took regarding this prior to jumping on reddit. Did you ask them why they were upset and what you could do differently? Did you explain how their reaction made you feel to them? I think the first step is always asking these questions and more often than not you&#39;ll find the situation works itself out.

Not an asshole, but maybe should be paying a bakers tax. He’s 16, baking since 14. His family bought everything he uses and all his ingredients. I don’t think they’re entitled to all of it but baking is done in batches and I can see at least the mom being peeved she’s paying for entire batches of baked goods to go out her door every week. 100 different items in 2 years is an item/week with 4 weeks off. That adds up.

If you don&#39;t want to bake for them, I would support that decision.

NTA. I am curious though, who purchases all the ingrediants, pays the bills for the oven and cleans up the kitchen? It is an awesome hobby to bake, and what you do with your creations is totally up to you, but I could see from your family&#39;s perspective that if you&#39;re basically freeloading for all the requirements of the activity and never sharing the result with them that there is a disparity there. Of course getting mad is the least productive way to remedy that on their part, if that is in fact even the case of what is happening, but perhaps to totally avoid being the AH it would be best to acknowledge any contributions your family makes to your baking and repay it with some of the treats

-------------------------------------

NTA. 100 deserts over 2 years? That’s not excessive. So, over approx 730 days you took 100 of those days, and a few hours in those days to woo your lady.  If you changed baking treats to taking her in dates, your mom probably wouldn’t even blink. 

It was really sweet of you lady to remember to and take the time to make this  scrap book for you. It shows thought and care, just like you were showing thought and care with these little gestures.  I’m gonna wager at theory though, that your mom’s reaction is not about you. 

Humans are inherently self involved. We can’t help it, and it’s not necessarily a bad thing. Our first thought is about our needs and wants, because we need to focus on our need and wants to survive. When we don’t, we suffer, we burn out emotionally and physically. Think about the disposition of enablers, often they are miserable because instead of taking care of themselves to make sure they are there for others, they can put everyone else ahead of them and feel resentful and drained because they are trying to get what they need from other people. On the flip we may not recognize when we take too much. Like when you have a friend who is always listing to you about your problems but you never think to ask how they are, or has someone who always pays for you or does something for the betterment of the group. We are social animals, and part of growing up is to recognize that while you do need to prioritize yourself, you’re not alone in this world. It’s about balance, care for others, care for yourself to, and give back to those who give to you. 

So back to your mom. I could be off base, but if she was anything like my mom growing up she may feel like everything she does is thankless. Yeah that’s what you sign up for when you become a parent. You put your life into raising a person who may never be grateful for all that you gave up for them. What might have happened when your mom saw the scrapbook is that she felt a bit jealous perhaps. Maybe nobody has ever done that kind of thing for her, not growing up, not in a romantic relationship, and not from anyone in the family. Like I said, 100 deserts over 2 years isn’t much when you think about it, but seeing this consistent gesture of care can hurt if you’ve never had it, and now it’s presented to her. I’m sure over the past two years she saw you baking in the kitchen for your GF, so that you do this shouldn’t be a surprise. That’s why I think this emotional reaction isn’t about you. She knows you do this already, but only now asks why you don’t bake for the family? 

You should never feel under obligation to use your skills when you don’t want to. My brother loves to grill. It’s his hobby. He spends a lot of time on educating himself, collecting equipment, and when he smokes or grills he puts a lot of care into it. But we don’t ask him to, when he does it it’s an expression of care for the family. If we demanded he did it, it wouldn’t be as fun for him, or for us really.  Perhaps if he only did it for his wife and not the rest of us.... it’s his right to do as he wishes, but it can be... perceived that if he doesn’t show that same care for others that are important in his life that... maybe he didn’t care as much for the rest of us. 

You’re not the asshole here. You are under no obligation to do anything you don’t want with this hobby of yours. I would say that you might want to consider that the way you show that you care for your GF, could also be used to show you care for others. Maybe, perhaps, your mom needs you to show her you care now and then. She may not say it, or ask for it, and possibly saying “you need to bake for the family”  is a way to make her need for care not about her. Just.... well Mother’s Day is coming up in the US very soon. Make something nice for you mom. If you can talk about it, say you like baking as a gift, which is true. Now that you know she would appreciate these kinds of gifts, you will keep that in mind. Don’t bake out of obligation... but maybe, perhaps, extend that level of care beyond your girlfriend who appreciates it so much.  Everyone needs a little affection now and then.

Footnote, for the folks saying “well she could of just asked when he was making something if she could have some”. Asking for a gift is tacky, and asking for part of someone else’s gift is very tacky. Sometimes people may hint that they want you to do the same nice thing for them, but outright asking can come off as greedy or off putting. Exactly how it comes off as greedy and off putting when OP’s mom got upset. People close to you often won’t ask for you to show them affection. You may find that you want a hug or something from someone but you don’t want to prompt them. You just want them to give you affection because they want to, not because you had to ask for it. This is good to keep in mind, because if you remember to reach out more, people will be more inclined to reach back, AKA we get what we give. Sometimes we have to be the one who reaches first. The mom didn’t want to ask, because she wanted OP to give her a gift because he wanted to is what I am saying. This is an easy fix really. OP’s mom for certain could have been more graceful about it, but parents are not perfect. Nobody is

Obviously you have a girlfriend you want to impress and she’s great for making this great picture album (because she wants to impress you) but, is your family feeling left out? I think I need more info here. You have obviously written a post that will make reddit favor you and your gf. But do you ever cook for them? Are you only cooking for her family? I’m not seeing the whole picture here? Not saying you have to cook for them, but maybe showing an album of the great things you can make while giving them nothing does seem a little assholish.

NAH with borderline YTA. I understand that you’re young and excited to be with your girlfriend. It’s very sweet how she appreciates your baking and you enjoy baking for her. However, regardless of if they asked for dessert or not, you’re still living with your family. They won’t make you a scrapbook for all your desserts because you’re not dating them, but I’m sure they would enjoy and be appreciative if you made some for them. You live in the same house, making any kind of food is like doing the dishes or taking out the trash, you shouldn’t have to be asked. It should be “well I’m making these for my girlfriend, I’ll make an extra one for my family to try”. Hopefully they take care of you, provide for you, and raise you well; and even if you buy ingredients with your own money, you’re still using time is the kitchen that is a shared area, possibly when your family’s home. I would be hurt as well if my son didn’t think of me when cooking for other people.

Seriously what is it with all the baking posts lately? This one so clearly seems fake too. This happens every couple weeks in this reddit and it does my head in. Someone makes a post about X topic and then within a week there are dozens of posts on that topic and each additional one makes less and less sense as they try to keep it original.

NAH but is there a reason why you dont bake anything for your mom? I&#39;d think that you would bake something for Mother&#39;s  Day or her birthday? If you were my kid I wouldn&#39;t be mad but I would ask why you never baked me anything. It would make me question how you feel about me.

Wow you and your girlfriend sound like you have a lovely relationship unfortunately some families hate that they have lost all of there attention/control. My family were openly hostile to hubby when we were younger 14/15- 18/19 it took me moving out and going no contact for for my family to change but my husband is my rock he is the live of my life. Keep baking for you gf it&#39;s a very special thing that you guys share the book she made you made my heart melt. I would ignore your families bitter reaction and don&#39;t let it spoil your feelings. To keep the peace I would bake you family something nice tho and maybe they would also just like to appreciate your talents to.

INFO: who bought the baking supplies? 

Flour and sugar are hard to come by right now in many areas, and at the very least will necessitate am unnecessary trip to the grocery store and someone exposing themselves to COVID-19. You really shouldn’t be using any of your supplies right now for your own amusement since they can and should be rationed to reduce your public interactions and for staple products like bread (assuming you can also not get rice and pasta delivered easily).

ESH - your family should have been more supportive, buying you&#39;re both 16 and your family arent getting the desserts, its probably safe to assume you&#39;re giving them to your girlfriend and the leftovers got to your girlfriends family. You&#39;re using your families kitchen, they&#39;re providing food for you, it&#39;s nice to provide them with your baking.

Oh come *on.* NTA 

What a way to kill someone’s joy real quick. 100x over two years averages once a week for those two years. They never saw/ smelled/ heard you baking anything? They never wanted to take an interest until they saw you were being praised and acknowledged? 

Even if that’s the case, rather than being pissed that you were a thoughtful partner (and have a thoughtful gf) they could have looked at the scrapbook, shared in your pride, shared your joy and happiness, and said something like “wow it looks like you’ve gotten a lot of practice and you enjoy this, maybe you can bake for us too.” It doesn’t have to be a battle. They can be happy for you AND want to partake at the same time. 

Don’t stop baking. I’m not good at baking but there’s been at least a handful of days in the last year when I’ve felt so incredibly depressed, stuck, completely paralyzed, and plain old down that the only thing to make be stand up and be remotely human was to bake some cookies. If it’s something you enjoy, and your gf (who seems so sweet and it makes me so happy that she appreciates it!) also gets joy from it, and then you get more joy from her enjoying your bake—- just keep doing it. Don’t let them crush it. 

Make something for them every once in a while but let it still be your thing, not something that you have to do because you’re being forced. Does that make sense?

NTA- But go easy on your family, looking at a scrapbook of desserts would make anyone a little hangry.... maybe make a little extra for the fam next time, even if theyre a bitter bunch and nowhere near as apreciative.

Also your love for each other is beautiful and the time/ thought/ care/ appreciation that you both put into your dessert/ gifts is lovely.

NTA, I was going to say yes if you were baking for your gf and refusing to bake for your family, but they never asked. I don&#39;t understand why they&#39;d be upset if they never asked about it. You got into that habit to make your gf happy and there&#39;s nothing wrong with that.

I assume that you&#39;re living with your girlfriend and that is why she gets a lot of your baked stuff. If you had been at home I&#39;m sure the people there would&#39;ve gotten more. 

Perhaps explaining this to them might help. Also, the way one expresses their love to each person can be different. I would love to do binge watches with my girlfriend (if I had one lol) but not with my parents. That is not a marker of how much I love either one of these people. 

Your mother and sister may not have thought of it this way. I think their anger is understandable, but not justifiable. But I also think that you talking it out with them and explaining this is the best way to help them understand. 

Oh, almost forgot. You&#39;re definitely NTA.

YTA,
Although not on purpose, but this is your family. These people wiped your ass and raised you. I was sixteen once and I get the extremely myopic view of teenagers. It’s hard to appreciate your family and of course girlfriend takes precedence at that age (I did the same thing at 16, I’m 27 and taught teenagers), but as you get older you’re going to realize it’s a pretty shitty move to not do things for your actual family. You don’t necessarily  have to bake for them all the time but it would be a kind thing to share your talent with them. After all, these people know you for your entire life and will hopefully be there through thick and thin. Again, it’s hard to not be a selfish teenager but really think about all that you have because of your. It’s not hard to bake double or split the yield. Who’s oven are you using? Who’s house are you living in? Who has always been there for you?

Before I make a judgment, who’s paying for all the ingredients? If you are not paying for your own ingredients, never sharing with your family is a soft

I think your family’s reaction is a soft T A but I can kinda understand if they didn’t know how much you’ve made for your girlfriend. 

If you are paying for your own ingredients your family is T A.

Baking sounds like a great hobby at first, but the carbs you are intaking are going to be impossible to keep up with.

I wouldn&#39;t be so concerned about baking for your family as much as what your health is going to be like in 10 years.

Not fat shaming, but fat people die a lot faster than non-fat people. They also have a lower quality of life due to feeling generally shittier than healthier people.

If I were you, I&#39;d change that kitchen hobby into something a bit less hazardous to your health. Maybe a hobby on how to make veggies your favourite dish. That&#39;s a cooking hobby that&#39;s really worth developing. But hey, you do you.
