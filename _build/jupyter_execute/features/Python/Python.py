# Programming in Python

This series of lessons will cover the basics of a programming language called Python:

## "Some things to think about before you exhort everyone to code"

```{epigraph}
Programming knowledge is not a neutral thing

-- Miriam Posner
```

DH and information studies professor Miriam Posner has an excellent blog post, ["Some things to think about before you exhort everyone to code"](https://miriamposner.com/blog/some-things-to-think-about-before-you-exhort-everyone-to-code/), which addresses the gender, race, and class politics that surround programming languages. "Programming knowledge is not a neutral thing," Posner rightly argues. And she discusses how certain kinds of people, such as middle-class white men, are more likely to be exposed to programming languages at a young age and less likely to experience sexism and racism while learning them.

Before we dive into Python, we want to acknowledge that programming knowledge is not a neutral or natural thing. Programming knowledge is also not a superior form of knowledge. And it is not the best way to approach every problem.

## Why Learn a Programming Language?

With all that said, why might it be worthwhile to learn a programming language? 

* You can save time and energy by automating tasks
* You can collect and analyze cultural data from a different perspective, often at a larger scale
* You can gain more flexibility, customizability, and autonomy over your digital research projects
* You can better understand how data and programming languages shape contemporary society and culture 

## Why Python Specifically?

Ok but why Python specifically?

* Python resembles the English language and is readable for those who know English
* Python is known to have a relatively smooth learning curve
* Python is a broadly used and popular language
* Python is increasingly good for data science

Other commonly used programming languages for cultural analytics/digital humanities include [R](https://humanitiesdata.org/) and [JavaScript](https://the-javascripting-english-major.org/v1/).

## Learning Goals with Python

Our learning goals with Python are a little different than they might be in a straightforward Computer Science course. We're striving to:

* Learn how to use Python as a tool and apply it to cultural questions
* Learn how to read and think critically about Python code
* Learn how to tinker with existing Python code for our own purposes
* Learn how to better collaborate with computer scientists and software developers

## Python Version 3

 The latest version of Python is Python 3. Python 2 has officially been [retired](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/). You should not use Python 2.
 
 It's possible that you may come across old Python 2 code on the internet, which won't work with Python 3. A tell-tale difference between Python 3 and Python 2 code is the syntax for the `print()` function. 

### Python 3

In Python 3, the `print()` function requires parentheses.

print("Good riddance, Python 2!")

### Python 2

In Python 2, the `print()` function does not parentheses.

print "Good riddance, Python 2!""
