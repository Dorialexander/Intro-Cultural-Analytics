The {download`*Harry Potter* series text file (.txt) <../texts/literature/Harry-Potter-Novels-Shuffled.txt>`} includes all seven books from J.K. Rowling's *Harry Potter* series, with words randomly shuffled for each page. Each line of the file is tab-separated and contains information about the individual page number (e.g. hp1-15), the book number (e.g. hp1), and the randomly shuffled words for that page.
