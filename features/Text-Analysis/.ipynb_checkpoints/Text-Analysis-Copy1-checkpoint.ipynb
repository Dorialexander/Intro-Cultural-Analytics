had dreamed that part of it, that she had never gone out through the kitchen window at two or three in the morning to visit the birds. By that time in his life he would have so many notions about himself set in concrete. And having always believed that he slept lightly, he would not want to think that a girl of nine or ten could walk by him at such an hour in the night without his waking and asking of the dark, Who is it? What\u2019s the matter?',\n", "  'One Sunday, when Betsy Ann was eight years old, the barber asked her again if she wanted to see his pigeons, \u201cmy children.\u201d He had first asked her some three years before. The girl had been eager to see them then, imagining she would see the same frightened creatures who waddled and flew away whenever she chased them on sidewalks and in parks. The men and the girl had gone into the backyard, and the pigeons, in a furious greeting, had flown up and about the barber. \u201cOh, my babies,\u201d he said, making kissing sounds. \u201cDaddy\u2019s here.\u201d In an instant, Miles\u2019s head was surrounded by a colorful flutter of pigeon life. The birds settled on his head and his shoulders and along his thick, extended arms, and some of the birds looked down meanly at her. Betsy Ann screamed, sending the birds back into a flutter, which made her scream even louder. And still screaming, she ran back into the house. The men found her in the kitchen, her head buried in the lap of Miles\u2019s mother, her arms tight around the waist of the old woman, who had been sitting at the table having Sunday lunch with her husband.',\n", "  'What Betsy Ann Morgan and her father Robert did agree on was that the pigeons began with the barber Miles Patterson. Her father had known Miles long before the girl was born, before the thought to marry her mother had even crossed his mind. The barber lived in a gingerbread brown house with his old parents only a few doors down from the barbershop he owned on the corner of 3rd and L streets, Northwest. On some Sundays, after Betsy Ann had come back from church with Miss Jenny, Robert, as he believed his wife would have done, would take his daughter out to visit with relatives and friends in the neighborhoods just beyond Myrtle Street, Northeast, where father and daughter lived.',\n", "  'THE GIRL WHO RAISED PIGEONS',\n", "  'But the night visits were not dreams, and they remained forever as vivid to her as the memory of the way the pigeons\u2019 iridescent necklaces flirted with light. The visits would begin not with any compulsion in her sleeping mind to visit, but with the simple need to pee or to get a drink of water. In the dark, she went barefoot out of her room, past her father in the front room conversing in his sleep, across the kitchen and through the kitchen window, out over the roof a few steps to the coop. It could be winter, it could be summer, but the most she ever got was something she called pigeon silence. Sometimes she had the urge to unlatch the door and go into the coop, or, at the very least, to try to reach through the wire and the wooden slats to stroke a wing or a breast, to share whatever the silence seemed to conceal. But she always kept her hands to herself, and after a few minutes, as if relieved, she would go back to her bed and visit the birds again in sleep.'],\n", " ['\u201cBuster,\u201d Miles\u2019s mother said to him, \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t scare your company like this.

And the more he told her no, that it was impossible, the more she wanted them. He warned her that he would not do anything to help her care for them, he warned her that all the bird-work meant she would not ever again have time to play with her friends, he warned her about all the do-do the pigeons would let loose. But she remained a bulldog about it, and he knew that she was not often a bulldog about anything. In the end he retreated to the fact that they were only renters in Jenny and Walter Creed\u2019s house.',\n", "  '\u201cPeople may like birds, but nobody in the world likes pigeons.\u201d',\n", "  'Three years later Betsy Ann said yes again to seeing the birds. In the backyard, there was again the same fluttering chaos, but this time the sight of the wings and bodies settling about Miles intrigued her and she drew closer until she was a foot or so away, looking up at them and stretching out her arm as she saw Miles doing. \u201cOh, my babies,\u201d the barber said. \u201cYour daddy\u2019s here.\u201d One of the birds landed on Betsy Ann\u2019s shoulder and another in the palm of her hand. The gray one in her hand looked dead at Betsy Ann, blinked, then swiveled his head and gave the girl a different view of a radiant black necklace. \u201cThey tickle,\u201d she said to her father, who stood back.',\n", "  '\u201cMiss Jenny likes birds,\u201d the girl said. \u201cMr. Creed likes birds, too.\u201d'],\n", " ['\u201cCept Mr. Miles,\u201d she said.',\n", "  'It was not difficult for the girl to convince Miss Jenny, though the old woman made it known that \u201cpigeons carry all them diseases, child.\u201d But there were few things Jenny Creed would deny Betsy Ann. The girl was known by all the world to be a good and obedient child. And in Miss Jenny\u2019s eyes, a child\u2019s good reputation amounted to an assent from God on most things.',\n", "  'They lived in the apartment Jenny and Walter Creed had made out of the upstairs in their Myrtle Street house. Miss Jenny had known Clara, Robert\u2019s wife, practically all of Clara\u2019s life. But their relationship had become little more than hellos and good-byes as they passed in the street before Miss Jenny came upon Clara and Robert one rainy Saturday in the library park at Mt. Vernon Square. Miss Jenny had come out of Hahn\u2019s shoe store, crossed New York Avenue, and was going up 7th Street. At first, Miss Jenny thought the young man and woman, soaked through to the skin, sitting on the park bench under a blue umbrella, were feebleminded or straightout crazy. As she came closer, she could hear them laughing, and the young man was swinging the umbrella back and forth over their heads, so that the rain would fall first upon her and then upon himself.',\n", "  '\u201cDon\u2019t make judgments bout things with what you know bout Miles.\u201d Miles Patterson, a bachelor and, some women said, a virgin, was fifty-six years old and for the most part knew no more about the world than what he could experience in newspapers or on the radio and in his own neighborhood, beyond which he rarely ventured. \u201cThere\u2019s ain\u2019t nothing out there in the great beyond for me,\u201d Miles would say to people who talked with excitement about visiting such and such a place.',\n", "  'For years after he relented, Robert Morgan would rise every morning before his daughter, go out onto the roof, and peer into the coop he had constructed for her, looking for dead pigeons. At such a time in the morning, there would be only fragments of first light, falling in long, hopeful slivers over the birds and their house. Sometimes he would stare absently into the coop for a long time, because being half-asleep, his mind would forget why he was there. The murmuring pigeons, as they did with most of the world, would stare back, with looks more of curiosity than of fear or anticipation or welcome. He thought that by getting there in the morning before his daughter, he could spare her the sight and pain of any dead birds. His plan had always been to put any dead birds he found into a burlap sack, take them down to his taxicab, and dispose of them on his way to work. He never intended to tell her about such birds, and it never occurred to him that she would know every pigeon in the coop and would wonder, perhaps even worry, about a missing bird.'],\n", " ['\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. He\u2014\u201d She pushed Robert and began to laugh. \u201cWe came out of Peoples and he wouldn\u2019t let me have none a the umbrella.

Miss Jenny took Clara\u2019s hand and held it close to her face.',\n", "  '\u201cOh oh,\u201d she said again and again, pulling Clara\u2019s hand still closer.',\n", "  'The couple learned the next week that the place above Miss Jenny was vacant and the following Sunday, Clara and Robert, dressed as if they had just come from church, were at her front door, inquiring about the apartment.',\n", "  '\u201cThis Robert,\u201d Clara said. \u201cMy\u201d\u2014and she turned to look at him\u2014\u201cfianc\u00e9.\u201d She uttered the word with a certain crispness: It was clear that before Robert Morgan, fianc\u00e9 was a word she had perhaps never uttered in her life.',\n", "  'Robert and Miss Jenny shook hands. \u201cYou gonna give her double pneumonia even before she take your name,\u201d she said.'],\n", " ['The weeks after her death Robert and the infant were attended to by family and friends.

Robert came to believe later that the tumor that would consume his wife\u2019s brain had been growing even on that rainy day. And it was there all those times he made love to her, and the thought that it was there, perhaps at first no bigger than a grain of salt, made him feel that he had somehow used her, taken from her even as she was moving toward death. He would not remember until much, much later the times she told him he gave her pleasure, when she whispered into his ear that she was glad she had found him, raised her head in that bed as she lay under him. And when he did remember, he would have to take out her photograph from the small box of valuables he kept in the dresser\u2019s top drawer, for he could not remember her face any other way.',\n", "  'Clara spent most of the first months of her pregnancy in bed, propped up, reading movie magazines and listening to the radio, waiting for Robert to come home from work. Her once pretty face slowly began to collapse in on itself like fruit too long in the sun, eaten away by the rot that despoiled from the inside out. The last month or so she spent in the bed on the third floor at Gallinger Hospital. One morning, toward four o\u2019clock, they cut open her stomach and pulled out the child only moments after Clara died, mother and daughter passing each other as if along a corridor, one into death, the other into life.'],\n", " ['\u201cYes, yes.\u201d She turned around in her chair to face him fully. \u201cMy niece works for the city, and she say they can take care of chirren like this who don\u2019t have parents.

She seemed the most helpless thing he had ever known. It occurred to him perversely, as he settled her in, that if he decided to walk away forever from her and the carriage and all her stuff, to walk but a few yards and make his way up or down 1st Street for no place in particular, there was not a damn thing in the world she could do about it. The carriage was facing 1st Street Northeast, and with some effort\u2014because one of the wheels refused to turn with the others\u2014he maneuvered it around, pointing toward North Capitol Street.',\n", "  'The next morning, Saturday, he shaved and washed up while Betsy Ann was still sleeping, and after she woke and he had fed her again, he clothed her with a yellow outfit and its yellow bonnet that Wilma Ellis, the schoolteacher next door, had given Betsy Ann. He carried the carriage downstairs first, leaving the baby on a pallet of blankets. On the sidewalk he covered her with a light green blanket that Dr. Oscar Jackson and his family up the street had given the baby. The shades were down at Miss Jenny\u2019s windows, and he heard no sound, not even the dog\u2019s barking, as he came and went. At the child\u2019s kicking feet in the carriage he placed enough diapers and powdered formula to last an expedition to Baltimore. Beside her, he placed a blue rattle from the janitor Jake Horton across the street.',\n", "  'She did not come back up, as he had hoped, and he spent his first night alone with the child. Each time he managed to get the baby back to sleep after he fed her or changed her diaper, he would place her in the crib in the front room and sit without light at the kitchen table listening to the trains coming and going just beyond his window. He was nineteen years old.

A grownup\u2019s course was generally not an easy one, but that morning, as he made his way with the soundless wheels of the carriage, the children made way for Robert Morgan, for he was the man whose wife had passed away. At her wake, some of them had been held up by grownups so they could look down on Clara laid out in her pink casket in Miss Jenny\u2019s parlor. And though death and its rituals did not mean much beyond the wavering understanding that they would never see someone again, they knew from what their parents said and did that a clear path to the corner was perhaps the very least a widow man deserved.',\n", "  'Robert nodded as if he understood and the boys turned back. He took off his tie and put it in his pocket and unbuttoned his suit coat and the top two buttons of his shirt. Then he adjusted his hat and placed the rattle nearer the baby, who paid it no mind. And when the light changed, he maneuvered the carriage down off the sidewalk and crossed North Capitol into Northwest.',\n", "  'He did not linger on Myrtle Street; he planned to make the visits there on his way back that evening. Janet\u2019s boys, Carlos and Carleton, walked on either side of him up Myrtle to North Capitol, then to the corner of K Street. There they knew to turn back. Carlos, seven years old, told him to take it easy.

The few grownups on porches came down to the sidewalk and made a fuss over Betsy Ann. More than midway down the block, Janet Gordon, who had been one of Clara\u2019s best friends, came out and picked up the baby. It was too nice a day to have that blanket over her, she told Robert. You expectin to go all the way to Baltimore with all them diapers? she said.

For several weeks, in the morning, soon after she had dutifully gone in to fill the feed dish and replace the water, and after they had fortified themselves, the pigeons took to the air and returned to Miles.

At Ralph\u2019s L Street house, there were cookies almost as big as her face, and Aunt Thelma, Clara\u2019s oldest sister, who was, in fact, the very image of Clara. The girl had never had an overwhelming curiosity about her mother, but it fascinated her to see the face of the lady in all the pictures on a woman who moved and laughed and did mother things.'],\n", " ['About three weeks later, on an afternoon when she was about to begin the weekly job of thoroughly cleaning the entire coop, she saw the two eggs. She thought them a trick of the light at first\u2014two small and perfect wonders alone in that wonderless nest without any hallelujahs from the world. She put off the cleaning and stood looking at the male bird, who had moved off the nest for only a few seconds, rearrange himself on the nest and look at her from time to time in that bored way he had. The female bird was atop the coop, dozing. Betsy Ann got a chair from the kitchen and continued watching the male bird and the nest through the wire. \u201cTell me bout this,\u201d she said to them.',\n", "  'It was late spring when Betsy Ann first noticed the nest, some two feet up from the coop\u2019s floor in one of the twelve cubicles that made up the entire structure. The nest was nothing special, a crude, ill-formed thing of straw and dead leaves and other, uncertain material she later figured only her hapless birds could manage to find. They had not flown back to Miles in a long time, but she had never stopped thinking that it was on their minds each time they took to the air. So the nest was the first solid indication that the pigeons would stay forever, would go but would always return.',\n", "  'Myrtle Street was only one long block, running east to west. To the east, preventing the street from going any farther, was a high, medieval-like wall of stone across 1st Street, Northeast, and beyond the wall were the railroad tracks. To the west, across North Capitol, preventing Myrtle Street from going any farther in that direction, was the high school Gonzaga, where white boys were taught by white priests. When the colored people and their homes were gone, the wall and the tracks remained, and so did the high school, with the same boys being taught by the same priests.',\n", "  'That was the fall of 1957.',\n", "  'As it happened, Robert discovered the newly hatched squabs when he went to look for dead birds before going to work. About six that morning he peered into the coop and shivered to find two hideous, bug-eyed balls of movement. They were a dirty orange and looked like baby vultures. He looked about as if there might be someone responsible for it all. This was, he knew now, a point of no return for his child. He went back in to have his first cup of coffee of the day.'],\n", " ['He drank without enjoyment and listened to the chirping, unsettling, demanding. He would not wake his daughter just to let her know about the hatchlings.

Then she began to worry that he had brought in some disease that would ultimately devastate her flock.',\n", "  '\u201cWhatcha gonna do with him?\u201d Ralph asked, kneeling down beside Betsy Ann and poking the dead bird with a pencil.',\n", "  'It turned out that the first pigeon to die was a stranger, and Robert never knew anything about it. The bird appeared out of nowhere and was dead less than a week later. By then, a year or so after Miles gave her the yearlings, she had eight birds of various ages, resulting from hatches in her coop and from trades with the barber (\u201cfor variety\u2019s sake,\u201d he told her) and with a family in Anacostia. One morning before going to school, she noticed the stranger perched in one of the lower cubicles, a few inches up from the floor, and though he seemed submissive enough, she sensed that he would peck with all he had if she tried to move him out. His entire body, what little there was left of it, was a witness to misery. One ragged cream-colored tail feather stuck straight up, as if with resignation. His bill was pitted as if it had been sprayed with minute pellets, and his left eye was covered with a patch of dried blood and dirt and decaying flesh.',\n", "  'Days later, home for lunch with Ralph, she found the pigeon dead near the water tray, his wings spread out full as if he had been preparing for flight.'],\n", " ['\u201cBeaver would say something over his grave,\u201d Ralph said.',\n", "  '\u201cWhat?\u201d',\n", "  '\u201cBury him.

The birds looked down uninterestedly at them from various places around the coop. She dumped the dead bird in a pillowcase and took it across 1st Street to the grassy spot of ground near the Esso filling station in front of the medieval wall.

This rumor\u2014unlike the summer rumor among Washington\u2019s Negro children that Richard Nixon, if he were elected president, would make all the children go to school on Saturday from nine to twelve and cut their summer vacations in half\u2014this rumor had a long life. And as the boys scraped their knuckles on the ground playing Poison, as the girls jumped rope until their bouncing plaits came loose, as the boys filled the neighborhood with the sounds of amateur hammering as they built skating trucks, as the girls made up talk for dolls with names they would one day bestow on their children, their conversations were flavored with lighthearted speculation about how far the railroad would go. When one child fell out with another, it became standard to try to hurt the other with the \u201ctrue fact\u201d that the railroad was going to take his or her home. \u201cIt\u2019s a true fact, they called my daddy at his work and told him we could stay, but yall gotta go.

She got pleasure just from the mere presence of the pigeons, a pleasure that was akin to what she felt when she followed her Aunt Thelma about her house, or when she jumped double dutch for so long she had to drop to the ground to catch her breath. In the morning, the new sun rising higher, she would place her chair at the roof\u2019s edge. She could look down at tail-wagging Bosco looking up at her, down through the thick rope fence around the roof that Robert had put up when she was a year old. She would hum or sing some nonsense song she\u2019d made up, as the birds strutted and pecked and preened and flapped about in the bath water. And in the evening she watched the pigeons return home, first landing in the oak tree, then over to the coop\u2019s landing board. A few of them, generally the males, would settle on her book or on her head and shoulders. Stroking the breast of one, she would be rewarded with a cooing that was as pleasurable as music, and when the bird edged nearer so that it was less than an inch away, she smelled what seemed a mixture of dirt and rainy air and heard a heart that seemed to be hurling itself against the wall of the bird\u2019s breast.'],\n", " ['Ralph was the first colored child anyone knew to have his own television. In his house there had been three bedrooms, but Thelma persuaded her husband that an asthmatic child needed more space. Her husband knocked down the walls between the two back bedrooms and Ralph then had a bedroom that was nearly twice as large as that of his parents. And in that enormous room, she put as much of the world as she and her husband could afford.',\n", "  'There were only two other girls on Myrtle Street who were comfortable around pigeons, and both of them moved away within a month of each other. One, LaDeidre Gordon, was a cousin of the brothers Carlos and Carleton. LaDeidre believed that the pigeons spoke a secret language among themselves, and that if she listened long enough and hard enough she could understand what they were saying and, ultimately, could communicate with them. For this, the world lovingly nicknamed her \u201cCoo-Coo.\u201d After LaDeidre and the second girl moved, Betsy Ann would take the long way around to avoid passing where they had lived. And in those weeks she found a comfort of sorts at Thelma and Ralph\u2019s, for their house and everything else on the other side of North Capitol Street, the rumor went, would be spared by the railroad people.',\n", "  'Aside from watching Thelma, what Betsy Ann enjoyed most in that house was the electric train set, which dominated the center of Ralph\u2019s room. Over an area of more than four square feet, running on three levels, the trains moved through a marvelous and complete world Ralph\u2019s father had constructed. In that world, there were no simple plastic figures waving beside the tracks. Rather, it was populated with such people as a hand-carved woman of wood, in a floppy hat and gardener\u2019s outfit of real cloth, a woman who had nearly microscopic beads of sweat on her brow as she knelt down with concentration in her flower garden; several inches away, hand-carved schoolchildren romped about in the playground. One group of children was playing tag, and on one boy\u2019s face was absolute surprise as he was being tagged by a girl whose cheek was lightly smudged with dirt. A foot or so away, in a small field, two hand-carved farmers of wood were arguing, one with his finger in the other\u2019s face and the other with his fist heading toward the chest of the first. The world also included a goat-populated mountain with a tunnel large enough for the trains to go through, and a stream made of light blue glass. The stream covered several tiny fish of many colors which had almost invisible pins holding them suspended from the bottom up to give the impression that the fish were swimming.',\n", "  'Thelma Holley, her husband, and Ralph lived in a small house on L Street, Northwest, two doors from Mt.

But even then, she felt God had given with one hand and taken with the other, for the boy suffered with asthma.

He had never stopped rising each morning before Betsy Ann and going out to the coop to see what pigeons might have died in the night. And that was what he did that last morning in midautumn. He touched down onto the roof and discovered it had snowed during the night. A light, nuisance powder, not thick enough to cover the world completely and make things beautiful the way he liked. Though there was enough sunlight, he did not at first notice the tiny tracks, with even tinier, intermittent spots of blood, leading from the coop, across his roof and over to the roof of the house next door, the schoolteacher\u2019s house that had been empty for more than four months. He did, however, hear the birds squawking before he reached the coop, but this meant nothing to him, because one pigeon sound was more or less like another to him.',\n", "  'He looked back at the window, for something had whispered that Betsy Ann was watching. But he was alone and he went into the coop. He took up one dead bird whose left wing and legs had been chewed off; he shook the bird gently, and gently he blew into its face. He prayed once more. The pigeons that were able had moved to the farthest corner of the coop and they watched him, quivering. He knew now that the squawking was the sound of pain and it drove him out of their house.'],\n", " ['When she asked what was the matter, the three only told her to go back to bed.

And when Robert told her to go back inside, she gave him the only no of their lives. He looked but once at her and then began to wring the necks of the birds injured beyond all hope. Strangely, when he reached for them, the pigeons did not peck, did not resist. He placed all of the bodies in the sacks, and when he was all done and stood covered in blood and viscera and feathers, he began to cry.',\n", "  'Betsy Ann and her father noticed almost simultaneously that there were two birds completely unharmed, huddled in an upper corner of the coop. After he tied the mouths of the sacks, the two birds, as if of one mind, flew together to the landing board and from there to the oak tree in Miss Jenny\u2019s yard. Then they were gone. The girl buried her face in Walter\u2019s side, and when the old man saw that she was barefoot, he picked her up.',\n", "  'He did not knock at Walter and Miss Jenny\u2019s door and wait to go in, as he had done each morning for some thirteen years. He found them at the breakfast table, and because they had been used to thirteen years of knocking, they looked up at him, amazed. Most of his words were garbled, but they followed him back upstairs.

She stood barefoot in the doorway leading from the front room to the kitchen, blinking herself awake.'],\n", " ['THE FIRST DAY',\n", "  'For many weeks, well into winter, one of the birds that had not been harmed would come to the ledge of a back window of an abandoned house that faced K Street. The bird, a typical gray, would stand on the ledge and appear to look across the backyards in the direction of Betsy Ann\u2019s roof, now an empty space because the coop had been dismantled for use as firewood in Miss Jenny\u2019s kitchen stove. When the girl first noticed him and realized who he was, she said nothing, but after a few days, she began to call to him, beseech him to come to her. She came to the very edge of the roof, for now the rope fence was gone and nothing held her back. When the bird would not come to her, she cursed him. After as much as an hour it would fly away and return the next morning.',\n", "  'She missed them more than she ever thought she would. In school, her mind would wander and she would doodle so many pigeons on the backs of her hands and along her arms that teachers called her Nasty, nasty girl. In the bathtub at night, she would cry to have to wash them off. And as she slept, missing them would take shape and lean down over her bed and wake her just enough to get her to understand a whisper that told her all over again how much she missed them. And when she raged in her sleep, Robert would come in and hold her until she returned to peace. He would sit in a chair beside her bed for the rest of the night, for her rages usually came about four in the morning and with the night so near morning, he saw no use in going back to bed.',\n", "  'She roamed the city at will, and Robert said nothing. She came to know the city so well that had she been blindfolded and taken to practically any place in Washington, even as far away as Anacostia or Georgetown, she could have taken off the blindfold and walked home without a moment\u2019s trouble. Her favorite place became the library park at Mount Vernon Square, the same park where Miss Jenny had first seen Robert and Clara together, across the street from the Peoples where Betsy Ann had been caught stealing. And there on some warm days Robert would find her, sitting on a bench, or lying on the grass, eyes to the sky.',\n", "  'On what turned out to be the last day, a very cold morning in February, she stepped out onto the roof to drink the last of her cocoa. At first she sipped, then she took one final swallow, and in the time it took her to raise the cup to her lips and lower it, the pigeon had taken a step and dropped from the ledge. He caught an upwind that took him nearly as high as the tops of the empty K Street houses. He flew farther into Northeast, into the colors and sounds of the city\u2019s morning. She did nothing, aside from following him, with her eyes, with her heart, as far as she could.'],\n", " ['Just inside the front door, women out of the advertisements in Ebony are greeting other parents and children.

My mother has uncharacteristically spent nearly an hour on my hair that morning, plaiting and replaiting so that now my scalp tingles.

The smell is somehow a soothing one now and I will reach for it time and time again before the morning ends. All the plaits, each with a blue barrette near the tip and each twisted into an uncommon sturdiness, will last until I go to bed that night, something that has never happened before. My stomach is full of milk and oatmeal sweetened with brown sugar. Like everything else I have on, my pale green slip and underwear are new, the underwear having come three to a plastic package with a little girl on the front who appears to be dancing. Behind my ears, my mother, to stop my whining, has dabbed the stingiest bit of her gardenia perfume, the last present my father gave her before he disappeared into memory. Because I cannot smell it, I have only her word that the perfume is there. I am also wearing yellow socks trimmed with thin lines of black and white around the tops.

Gladys explained that her mother wanted a few small boxes of stuff taken to Gladys\u2019s father in Anacostia. Cassandra didn\u2019t know Gladys at all, except to see her now and again passing in the school\u2019s halls. Taking boxes from the mother to the father all the way in Anacostia seemed strange to Cassandra, but being an orphan set adrift in the world she had learned that unless it could involve a death mistake, it was best to ask as few questions as possible. And besides, twenty bucks was twenty bucks. Anita and Melanie said they wouldn\u2019t mind coming along: Melanie\u2019s boyfriend had football practice, and Friday evenings Anita\u2019s parents allowed her a bit more leeway than they did on school nights.',\n", "  '\u201cI think she said her mother\u2019ll pay twenty dollars.

She and Gladys waited while Anita and Melanie took their books home, a short distance away. When they returned, Cassandra started up the car without any trouble and the four drove down Clifton Street to Gladys\u2019s house on 12th Street. The house and the yard were uncommonly immaculate. Such houses made Cassandra nervous, because she associated them with owners who, without warning, smacked the hands of visiting children reaching out with curiosity to touch something.',\n", "  '\u201cWhy don\u2019t you leave it alone,\u201d Cassandra said to her. \u201cYou want some music, make your own damn music.\u201d',\n", "  'It was a pleasant Friday evening in early November. The girls set off with an hour or so of the day\u2019s light remaining, and that light came through the last of the autumn leaves still clinging to the trees. The birds, somewhere among those leaves and among the nooks and crannies of buildings, were making a racket as they bedded down. Cassandra felt good, because her stomach was full and she had a little piece of change in her pocket and she had a bed waiting that night at Rhonda\u2019s. At Elson\u2019s at 11th and T she filled up the gas tank. They continued on down 11th Street. As usual when she drove, Cassandra leaned forward, her arms folded over the top of the steering wheel, the cigarette in her mouth bouncing up and down whenever she said anything. Gladys sat in the back, beside Anita, and in her lap was a small box of family photographs, the ones Mildred Harper could bear to part with. In the car\u2019s trunk were two larger boxes, containing the last of her father\u2019s stuff he had left at the house.

He\u2019s not well enough to come get them.\u201d They sounded like words she had already said a thousand times, had learned to say to get it all out and over with. Anita and Melanie must have heard it before, because they didn\u2019t seem surprised at what the mother was saying. After she had set out the food and told them to help themselves, Mildred Harper gave Cassandra a twenty-dollar bill and three dollars for gas and disappeared into another part of the house.'],\n", " ['\u201cRight,\u201d Cassandra said. \u201cPeople started standin up and shit and cheerin and everything.

She used to pin such notes to her pillow before she went off in the morning, leaving him still asleep. But in the night, when she brushed her hair as she prepared for bed, she would find the notes still pinned to the pillow, undisturbed and so perhaps unread. So now she taped them to milk cartons, for he could not begin his day without drinking milk, or she taped them to his gold key ring, or pinned them to the zippers of the expensive pants she knew he would wear that day.

At the very bottom of the display, in two and a half rows, there were also photographs of men who had, as Manny put it, \u201cmade irredeemable fools of themselves in my house,\u201d as he called his bar. Most of these men, usually too drunk even to remember where they were, had refused to leave the bar when told, and Manny had had the bouncers toss them out.

Take his goddamn picture!\u201d became his euphemism to the bouncers for throwing a man out and putting a hurting on him. The majority of the men were photographed leaning against the front of the bar just below the neon sign that blinked Manny\u2019s Haven.

A month before that he had placed the pistol beside the head of a man he and Sherman had caught far up New Hampshire Avenue near the Silver Spring line.

He took a bus downtown to see the woman for what would be the last time before Friday.',\n", "  'III',\n", "  'He had been following her for all of two months, since a week or so after he saw Sherman in the hospital. He had first come upon her waiting for the bus with three of her housemates. They were all adults, all at least thirty years old, but they talked as if they were new to the world and excited about being in it. The two men talked very loudly, as if they were not afraid to share whatever they were saying. Caesar figured from the beginning that the larger of the two women was the weakest, would be the easiest to pick off.',\n", "  '\u201cSeven\u2019s fine,\u201d Manny said, kissing the pictures and putting them back in his pocket. \u201cAny later and you\u2019ll be late.\u201d'],\n", " ['On Saturdays, she came to work at noon and stayed until eight or nine in the evening. But it was only the Fridays that concerned him now. For on Fridays, each Friday evening, she left work and walked up Connecticut Avenue to Dupont Circle, where she deposited her paycheck at American Security. He would stand beside her on most Fridays over those months as she took forever to fill out the deposit slip, making first one mistake, then another, then dropping the crossed-out slips into the wastebasket beside the table. After she got on line, he would pick up every slip she had dropped. Then he would stand behind her until she had completed things with the teller.',\n", "  'It was a little before two when he got to the restaurant. The retarded woman and her friend soon came out to Connecticut, heading for Lafayette Park. Not quite two thirty, but close enough to the times of other days not to worry. As the women often did, they walked holding hands. They wore green uniforms and though they seemed to polish their white shoes every day, he had noticed that they were scuffed plenty by midday. He knew their first and last names, he knew where the old woman lived, having followed her home one evening, he knew the retarded woman\u2019s favorite candy, he even knew the station the old woman had her radio tuned to.',\n", "  'Week after week, Caesar had followed the retarded woman as she made her way to work, sitting in the back of the bus so he could see when she got off. At K Street, she always walked the block and a half to the restaurant. He hung around near the restaurant, sometimes for the entire day, learning her schedule. He often saw her sweeping up the alley in the back where the employees entered and where deliveries were made. About two thirty or so most afternoons, after they had probably eaten lunch, the retarded woman and a much older woman would walk to Lafayette Park and stay for up to thirty minutes. After they went back to work, he would not see the girl again until about five, when she left work and took the bus home.',\n", "  'And so for two months he had secretly placed himself in her life, doing all the scoping out, the drudgery that had once been left up to Sherman. \u201cYou\u2019d fuck it up,\u201d Sherman had said once. \u201cI know you.\u201d \u201cHave some faith in me,\u201d Caesar would laugh. \u201cHave a little faith.\u201d \u201cI know you, mothafucka.\u201d',\n", "  '\u201cI can see me sometime holdin my own little baby,\u201d the retarded woman said after they sat down on a bench facing the White House, \u201crockin her and feedin her and doin such.\u201d The sun was warm, and Caesar sat on the grass Indian-style a few feet behind the women. He opened a newspaper he had taken from a trash can, but he watched the tourists taking photographs and the government people eating their lunches.'],\n", " ['\u201cPeople call us the lovebirds,\u201d the retarded woman said. \u201c\u2018Look at em. Look at them lovebirds.\u2019\u201d',\n", "  'The old woman was eating orange pieces from a small plastic bag, and now and again, when the breeze shifted, the smell of oranges came to Caesar. He watched a black family come up to a very old white man at the Lafayette statue. The father gave his camera to the white man and then stood in front of the statue beside his wife and behind his three children. The oldest boy closed his eyes and would not open them again until it was all done. The old man took the family\u2019s picture, and when the mother raised one finger, the old man advanced the film and snapped again.',\n", "  'Caesar knew about her Fred, but he had never learned if he was one of those loud talkers he had seen in the first weeks at the bus stop.',\n", "  '\u201cThen he commence to change. He talk back to Miss Prentiss,\u201d the retarded woman was saying. \u201cHis job call Miss Prentiss and said he all the time late. Wouldn\u2019t do what they told him.\u201d',\n", "  '\u201cThought everything would work with Fred and me,\u201d the retarded woman said. \u201cHe like the job they got him. Me and him would sit on the stoop, makin plans bout our future.\u201d'],\n", " ['Caesar was only half listening; there was no more that would help on Friday. The problem would be Carol. He put the newspaper aside and lay down, closing his eyes. He would not follow them back to work. On another day not long ago, he had waited for the retarded woman across the street in front of the copier business until she got off from work. He had followed her to the bus stop. She was overweight, and he saw that walking was not easy for her in the heat. For the first time since he had been following her, she was not wearing her uniform. She had on a blue skirt and a pink blouse, which she wore outside the skirt. She had on tiny, gold-plated earrings a person might not notice until he was within a foot or so of her, and that was how close he was when he walked past her. She smelled of garlic and, beneath that, of a soap that reminded him of the halls in the hospital where his mother had died.',\n", "  'It was a crime, Sherman had said, to fall asleep anywhere but in a safe place, and so he was up and off a few minutes after the women left. He felt he wanted to see Sherman and left the park at the corner of Pennsylvania and 16th, heading in the direction where he thought the museum was. In both his lives, he had never come down to the world below Constitution Avenue, except for those times when relatives came from out of town. His mother and father would bring everyone down to see the Washington they put on postcards and in the pages of expensive coffee-table books. He knew that his father worked in one of the government buildings, but he didn\u2019t know which one. His father was the kind of man who, if he looked out his office window and saw his son, would come down the stairs three at a time and hold him until someone called the police. \u201cCall the law! I have a thief who robbed me! Call the law!\u201d',\n", "  'The black family crossed Pennsylvania Avenue, and the father gave the oldest boy the camera so he could take pictures of the White House.

Yesday I got home, a car came with two men and they took him back to Laurel.\u201d Caesar watched as the father read what was on the side of the statue and then the father looked up at the man on the horse, shading his eyes. His little girl did the same.'],\n", " ['He promised to fix her dinner before he went to Manny\u2019s and he told her once again that he loved her.',\n", "  '\u201cI wish I could record that,\u201d she said, \u201cand play it back any time I wanted.\u201d',\n", "  'He told her that he loved her, then he told her that he missed her. In his mind, he read the words written on her notes.',\n", "  'At 15th and Constitution, among the tourists and office workers, he gave up the idea of seeing Sherman. It would be better to start working on Carol. He could see no problems with Anna, the retarded woman, but retarded or not, she was still a woman and there was a danger of her being skittish. He called Carol at work.',\n", "  '\u201cI\u2019m glad you told me,\u201d she said. \u201cI was beginning to wonder. You made my day.\u201d'],\n", " ['IV',\n", "  'One night in April, Sherman dropped him off about three in the morning, and Caesar stood on the sidewalk for a long while looking up at his house. For the first time, all the lights in the house were off. When he opened the front door, his father was standing before him in the darkened hall.',\n", "  'Caesar, though, was moved, and they grew closer after his mother\u2019s funeral. Angelo introduced him to Sherman. Angelo, before Caesar gave up on school, would wait for him outside Cardozo High, and they would go to Sherman\u2019s two-bedroom apartment on 16th Street, a few blocks up from Malcolm X Park. What fascinated Caesar most about the apartment was the dominance of sound, of noise, as if Sherman were afraid of silence. In every room, there was something playing each second of the day, whether a radio or television or cassette player. In the bathroom, hanging from the shower curtain rod, there was a transistor radio that played around the clock. Sherman lived alone in the apartment, but he had two children by Sandra, who lived elsewhere in the building with the children. Most of the time when Caesar and Angelo visited, they would find Sherman wrapped in his bathrobe sitting on the couch, listening to one of dozens of cassette tapes that Sandra had recorded of the children talking and playing with each other. There were four speakers in the living room that stood three feet high, and he enjoyed playing those cassettes so loud that the noise of the children made it sound like a playground with a hundred children. Now and again, one child would hit the other or say something mean and there would be a fit of crying on the tape. Sherman would jump up and speed the tape past the crying to a place where the talking and playing resumed.',\n", "  'The apartment, despite the noise, became another home for Caesar and he began going there without Angelo after school. Before long, he was leaving home at least two or three days a week and going not to school but straight to Sherman\u2019s place, where he\u2019d drop his books at the door beside the two-foot-high porcelain bulldog and make a place for himself in front of the television. In the beginning, he was able to get back home in the evening before his father arrived from work. But as the months wore away to winter, to spring, he was getting home later and later.',\n", "  'When people found out that Angelo Billings, Caesar\u2019s cousin, had in fact stolen the flowers from an I Street florist and taken them to the funeral home, they said he would never again have good luck. Never mind, they said, that he loved Caesar\u2019s mother as much as he loved anyone and that stealing the flowers was his way of showing that love. There were some things God would not tolerate, and stealing flowers for the dead was one of them.'],\n", " ['He got to his feet and looked up and down French Street. The new leaves rattled as if something were shaking the trees, and the sound unnerved him. He brushed off his clothes, not because of dirt or debris, but because right then he did not know what else to do. Under the street lamp, he looked at the watch Sherman had given him the week before, and it occurred to him that he had never before been awake at that hour in the morning. A cool wind sauntered up the street and chilled him, unnerving him even more, and he suppressed the urge to cry.',\n", "  '\u201cI\u2019m just slaving away my life to raise up another Angelo,\u201d his father hissed, turning on the hall light. \u201cA goddamn no-account.\u201d As soon as his hand was off the light switch, he slapped Caesar, knocking him back against the front door. Before Caesar could recover, his father had grabbed him by the shirt with one hand, opened the door with the other, and threw him out on the sidewalk.',\n", "  '\u201cI gave you more chances than you deserved,\u201d his father said and closed the inner and outer doors to the house. Caesar, still sprawled on the ground, saw the hall light go out. Seconds later, he saw the light in the upstairs front bedroom, his father\u2019s room, go on, and a moment later, that light went out.',\n", "  'He saw the brighter lights at the half smoke joint at the 9th Street corner and he went toward those lights. The place was closed, but he used the outdoor telephone to call Sherman. Sandra answered, and after he had told her what happened, she told him to stay put, that Sherman would be back down to pick him up. While he waited, he called his father\u2019s house several times, stepping out of the telephone booth with the receiver as he listened to the ringing. He looked up tree-lined French Street, but there was not enough light to distinguish his house from all the others.',\n", "  'He considered pounding on the door, calling his father as loudly as he could and then running away. But he stood quiet. For all of his life, he had been Lemuel Matthews\u2019s son, and even now, standing in the dark outside the walls of his father\u2019s house, he was still his son and he knew he could not be a bad boy at such a place at such a time in the morning.'],\n", " ['\u201cThe first thing we do,\u201d Sherman said one day, \u201cis get all your shit from your daddy\u2019s place. You gotta have an identity. Get you out in the world so you can stop all that mopin.\u201d',\n", "  'Sherman had thought that Angelo, eager, cocksure, had potential as a partner, but soon after the government people put Angelo away, he began to consider Caesar, who was now staying with him. Caesar knew Sherman didn\u2019t have a real job, but he didn\u2019t learn until he had been with him two months what he did for a living. He was not particularly surprised or disappointed. Caesar was seventeen, and for the first time in his life, he was living his days without the cocoon of family, and beyond that cocoon, he was learning, anything was possible.',\n", "  '\u201cLet\u2019s get your stuff,\u201d Sherman said after a bit. \u201cEnough of this.\u201d',\n", "  'The next morning they drove down to the house on French Street and waited in the car until Caesar was certain his father had left for work and his brother and sister had gone to school. Caesar opened the front door with his key. He was surprised his father had not changed the lock, but Sherman was not surprised. \u201cWhat\u2019s there to be afraid of from his own little boy?\u201d Sherman said. Caesar stepped into the hall. Had his father suddenly appeared before him, it would have seemed the most natural thing. Indeed, he expected him, and when he stepped into the living room, he expected his father to be there as well. Sherman, silent, followed as Caesar went through the rooms on the first floor. Caesar touched nearly everything along the way\u2014a lace piece made by his grandmother that was on the back of the easy chair in the living room; a drawing of the house signed and dated by his sister taped to the refrigerator; the kitchen curtains he had helped his mother put up. In a corner of the kitchen counter he found wrapped in a rubber band the letters he had been sending to his father; only the first one had been opened.',\n", "  'It was true what people said about Angelo\u2019s bad luck. He robbed the Riggs Bank on 15th Street in early May, using a gun he had rented for twenty-five dollars a day and a Safeway shopping bag. He was so curious about how much he had gotten away with that as he ran down M Street, he looked in the shopping bag, and at that moment the money, booby-trapped with a red dye packet, exploded in his face. He dropped the bag, cursing the bank teller, but he continued running, trying for the next several blocks to wipe the dye from his face and hands with the shirt he had taken off.'],\n", " ['\u201cNo.\u201d He turned away and went to his sister\u2019s room, where he touched the heads of the three stuffed animals sitting on the pillows of her bed. In the room he had shared with his brother, he took as many of his clothes as he could carry, his hands shaking each time he picked up an item.',\n", "  'Caesar nodded. In a few minutes they were on 11th Street, heading back uptown. He knew what his father would look like when he realized he had been robbed: the fist pounding the air, that pulsating vein at the left side of his head. For months and months after that, he could conjure up the image whenever he wanted and replay it. That night, they went to Manny\u2019s and Carol said what she said about dancing with her not ending that way, about trying her and seeing. She took him home that night, and when he woke up the next morning, she was lying on her side watching him. She leaned over and kissed his forehead. \u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d she said, \u201cI already went and brushed my teeth.\u201d Aside from the ones in Sherman\u2019s magazines, she was the first naked woman he had ever seen. She kissed his ear. \u201cThere\u2019s a toothbrush in there with your name on it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I bet I spelled your name right.\u201d',\n", "  '\u201cYou want your mom\u2019s death certificate?\u201d Sherman said, reaching the end of the papers in the box.',\n", "  'In the hall, Sherman was waiting at the head of the stairs. He took some of the clothes from Caesar. \u201cHe had a little money in the box, some cash and some gold pieces,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cAnd I found a stack of pictures in a drawer. I got a few of em, mostly some with you in em. Must be your mother, too. I got a lot of em. You might want em later on when you start to forget.\u201d',\n", "  'They went upstairs, and in the closet of his father\u2019s bedroom, Sherman found a small metal box, broke its tiny lock with his hand, and leisurely went through the papers in the box, putting aside Caesar\u2019s birth certificate and the Social Security card he had gotten the year before in hopes of finding an after-school job. Caesar watched.'],\n", " ['On the way home from following Anna that last time, Caesar bought white carnations for Carol and the ingredients for a shrimp creole dinner. He had dinner prepared when she came home, and after they had eaten, with her head swirling just a bit from the wine, he made love to her because he did not know what kind of mood he would be in when he returned from Manny\u2019s that night.',\n", "  'V',\n", "  '\u201cDon\u2019t ask me to do any of that,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t bring me into any of that.\u201d As long as she believed it did not involve another woman, she had never wanted to know what he and Sherman did. But now she felt all of the not-wanting-to-know had come due and she pulled the sheet up to her neck against the cold.',\n", "  'Two weeks after Caesar and Sherman went into Caesar\u2019s father\u2019s house, Sherman took him out for the first time, to burglarize a home in Chevy Chase. Sherman peed on the sofa in the recreation room, having taken a quick dislike to a large painting behind the sofa of a man in a tennis outfit whom he took to be the owner. The next night, in a light rain, they followed a light-skinned, well-dressed fellow from a bar on Capitol Hill to his car parked a block away. The man had tottered the whole distance, not bothering to open the umbrella he was carrying. \u201cNot a sound,\u201d Caesar said, placing the pistol at the man\u2019s head just as he stuck his key in the car door. \u201cNot a sound. No words. Not one word.\u201d Sherman went through the man\u2019s pockets, took his wallet and then his watch. \u201cPlease, please,\u201d the man kept saying, his arms extended high into the air. The man was balding and the hair he had left was combed perfectly to either side of a bald path that went back to the middle of his head. With the light of the street lamps, the robbers could see the beads of rain on the bald path and on his eyeglasses. \u201cNext time,\u201d Caesar said as they stepped away from the man, \u201cbuy your shit in a liquor store and take it home to drink.\u201d',\n", "  'Later, as he told her about the retarded woman, he rested his hand on her bare stomach. He could feel her tensing up with each word.

Caesar had taken it from Manny\u2019s wall of Polaroids, but no one at the bar, not even Manny, could remember who the child was. Carol, however, believed that Caesar knew the boy, and when Caesar laughed, she had flung the picture at him.

Generally, she owed about a hundred dollars; and rarely paid more than five dollars on the bill from month to month.

About six thirty that morning, their father, Samuel, called his sister Maddie to tell her what he had done, how he had done it. \u201cI stabbed her a lot,\u201d Samuel said, and though Maddie was still rising up from sleep as he talked, those words were forever imprinted on her mind. He told her to come get his babies, that soon they would be up and ready to eat. As far as anyone could ever tell, the two-minute-or-so conversation he had with Maddie was all he would ever say in life about the murder of a woman the whole world believed he loved\u2014give or take this or that\u2014more than anything. After that, the most Samuel would ever say to anyone about it, including his own attorney, was that he was the one.',\n", "  'When Maddie arrived at the apartment that morning, she found her brother sitting in near-darkness on the floor near the couch, the telephone resting like a black pet on his lap. Still not quite fully awake, Maddie had traveled the three blocks to the M Street apartment only partially aware of what she was doing. Samuel was dressed only in his underwear; there was no sign of trouble about him that she could see, and for a bit this gave her comfort, and this was what she told the courtroom one sweltering day in July.'],\n", " ['Maddie called the police. She went back to close the door of the adults\u2019 bedroom and went to the children\u2019s room. It took her a few minutes to wake the children and help them dress. As usual, Pookie, as Sam Williams was then called, acted as if he were older than his ten years and dressed without much fuss. But Madeleine was a problem. She complained that she was hungry, and her aunt told her she would get all the food she wanted at her place. Then Madeleine could not find her doll, and it took the three of them several minutes of hunting about the room to find it. Finally, before their aunt opened the door, Pookie said he had to pee. Maddie told him to hold it and Pookie quietly told her that maybe he couldn\u2019t, that he might pee on himself. \u201cI told him we were in a hurry,\u201d Maddie would tell Madeleine years later, \u201cand that if he did pee on hisself, it wouldn\u2019t be the worse thing in the world for a boy to do.\u201d',\n", "  '\u201cSay somethin, gotdamnit!

In her left hand, the greatest friend of Maddie\u2019s life gripped a hairbrush, and her right hand was open, also resting on the floor, palm up, as if expecting a small surprise to be dropped into it. It seemed to Maddie right then that all the innocence and joy and kindness had seeped out of Agnes Marie Williams and had become the pool of blood about her. The floor tilted, and so the blood had flowed through the night in several thin lines from the dead woman, and one line had been heading directly toward where Maddie was standing in the doorway. The front of Agnes\u2019s nightgown was soaked through with blood. \u201cHe said to me on the phone, \u2018I stabbed her a lot.\u2019\u201d These words her niece, Madeleine, would find on page twenty-eight of her $75.86 copy of the trial transcript.

Sometimes, for years after she took the children into her life, as she lay on that freed hair in the arms of some man after they both had come and come again and the man was no longer drowning her with such foolishness about baby this and baby that, she would find herself beginning to fall asleep.

But each time she called on the telephone or knocked on their door at the fine house on New Jersey Avenue, someone in Agnes\u2019s family would remind her that they had never wanted their daughter, their sister, their Aggie, to marry that man. \u201cWe knew he wasn\u2019t any good,\u201d they would say, and Maddie would go away knowing that what they really meant was that her brother had always been too dark for them.'],\n", " ['The children in the realm made up these words and they would chant, particularly when Pookie was around:',\n", "  'Most of Maddie\u2019s male friends had cars and they were all too happy to give her and the children a ride down to Lorton to visit Samuel.

At D Ward, after the attendant had wheeled the child Sam out of his ward and left without having spoken one word, Samuel bent down and kissed the boy on the cheek, which embarrassed Madeleine. Sam blinked once and then after a few seconds he blinked again. In the ward, those patients not in their beds were in wheelchairs, gathered around a very loud television set propped up on a dull blue bureau that had no drawers. The only person in the room who seemed interested in the television was an attendant painting her fingernails.',\n", "  'On the lawn there was a family fussing over a fellow who could have been five or in his teens or a man of thirty or so, and who was sitting in the lap of a woman who may have been his mother.

Knew their tabloid lives. It occurred to her that they were a part of the same tribe as the nearly toothless man who had come to her door that morning, saying he was her father. The more Arnisa talked, the more she was aware of how much time was going by and kept looking up the lane for the car that would take her back to Washington. Sam leaned his back against the woman\u2019s breasts and fell asleep.',\n", "  '\u201cYall be careful now,\u201d Arnisa said.

At her apartment, she got out without a word and did not hear Samuel say he was sorry. She opened the building\u2019s front door and made sure it locked behind her. When she was back in her apartment, she looked out the window and found that the car had died on him once again. The car was parked in a space near the entrance to the parking lot with its hood up and Samuel was leaning into the car, a man being swallowed up. She lived on the second floor, facing the parking lot, and she could hear him and what he was doing. White people passed and paid no attention to him.',\n", "  'They put Sam in his wheelchair, and as Samuel wheeled the boy up the ramp, Madeleine looked her father up and down. \u201cDon\u2019t you even know how to dress?

That morning she had looked forward to going to the deli down the street where she and Curtis sometimes bought sandwiches and pastries. But she knew she could not go out with Samuel blocking the path to the deli and the deli would soon be closed. There were few cars or people passing, and most of the world was quiet. The loudest sounds were those of her father\u2019s muttering and of his tools against the car\u2019s metal, all of it reminding her, first before anything else, that the day was forever wearing itself away.',\n", "  'When the telephone rang about three o\u2019clock that morning, she sat bolt upright in her bed, as if a giant hand had reached through the ceiling and snatched her up.

She first sat on the side of the bed and began to hope: a wrong number, or Gail, drunk, in from an evening of bar-hopping, calling to talk about a man.

One of her legs was resting across a chair arm, an old habit she was trying to break in the new house. She watched the sleeping boy and listened to the grandfather clock in the hall. Before Santiago and Humphrey were born, Joyce and Pearl had decided to share an apartment to save on the money they would get from public assistance. They discovered, a week or so after Humphrey was born, that Pearl\u2019s milk had mysteriously dried up, and Pearl became convinced that without her milk, her son would grow up without immunity.'],\n", " ['\u201cOh, girl, you worry too much\u201d Joyce told her one morning in a splendid June. \u201cThey makin formula and stuff thas just as good as breast milk.\u201d',\n", "  'In the very center of Joyce\u2019s coffee table, under the see-through glass, were pictures of her children and Pearl\u2019s as babies. Chubby-cheeked beings looking off to the side uninterestedly, or looking dead at the camera eye as if to challenge. Surrounding those pictures were photographs of the children in later years, and surrounding those were pictures of Joyce\u2019s parents and aunts and uncles and the children of her friends. There were pictures of her and Rickey together, arms around each other, and there were pictures of her alone, at the beach, at parties, sitting with crossed legs on the hoods of boyfriends\u2019 cars. In the top left-hand corner of the glass, there were cracks of one or two inches, radiating out, like the sun\u2019s rays in a child\u2019s drawing. Santiago, not long after they bought the table, had promised that if the cracks got any longer he would use his summer job money to replace the entire glass.',\n", "  'About two that morning Santiago called. The telephone sounded with the most unobtrusive chime she had been able to find. She was on the second floor, in the room she had furnished with such care and set aside for her mother, who would not ever step foot in her daughter\u2019s house. When she told Santiago that Humphrey was there, he told her not to let Humphrey leave. \u201cI been lookin for his bony ass for two whole days,\u201d he said.',\n", "  '\u201cJoyce, I don\u2019t wanna feed my baby outa no box.\u201d They were in their kitchen and Pearl, standing at the stove, was reading aloud every word on the box of formula. Then she held it to her ear and shook it, as if just the sound of the contents was evidence of a lack of something vital. \u201cHe\u2019ll get all those diseases. I read about it.\u201d The babies were in plastic carriers, setting on the table. Santiago was asleep and Humphrey was watching Joyce, who sat playing with his hair.',\n", "  'In the end, Joyce offered to feed Humphrey from her own breasts. And for the six months or so Pearl felt it took to give Humphrey protection against the world\u2019s diseases, Joyce would take him up and put him to her breast. \u201cI\u2019m gonna teach him to call you Mama Joyce,\u201d Pearl said, wiping sweat from her brow one day in the crushing humidity of August.'],\n", " ['\u201cHe downstairs sleepin,\u201d Joyce said, \u201cand I don\u2019t think he goin anywhere.\u201d She wanted to know where Rickey was, why he wasn\u2019t home yet, and Santiago told her that he would send Rickey home soon and that he himself would be staying at his Capitol Heights apartment if she needed him.',\n", "  'About three that morning, while Joyce stood looking out the third-floor hall window, Humphrey got up and stumbled out. She got downstairs and found the iron-bar and wooden doors open to the world. She discovered later that he had taken the money. Toward three thirty, Rickey, nearly dead on his feet, finally came home. She fixed him a sandwich with thick slices of ham and then sat across the kitchen table from him, sipping a beer. \u201cWhat a way to pay the rent,\u201d he kept saying between bites. She helped him upstairs and into bed. Then she roamed the house some more until about four thirty, when she came to bed and curled up close to him. But she could not sleep because she kept thinking she had not locked all the windows and doors.',\n", "  'The pictures of her mother started in the center of the coffee table display. Her mother rarely smiled in the photographs and she often looked into the camera as if the eye had caught her doing something God would not approve of. \u201cI just don\u2019t take the good pictures,\u201d her mother had said when she saw the display at the apartment Joyce had left behind.',\n", "  'The pictures of Rickey began under the see-through glass more or less where the photographs of Santiago at ten began. Rickey did not like having his picture taken, and so most of the photos were of him in unguarded moments. One was taken at somebody\u2019s house during Christmas. The camera had caught him with his mouth parted in a small O and the camera had given him red eyes. Rickey\u2019s pictures had replaced those of the two men who had fathered her three children. He was the first man in her life who had never beaten her. And for a long time she thought that because he did not beat her, he did not care for her as much and that one morning she would wake up and, like the others, he would be gone.',\n", "  'She had little use for sleep anymore, and after the call, she roamed the house with all the lights turned out, something she often did, even when Rickey was home. She and Pearl had shared poor-women dreams of living in a place like this, with furniture no one else in the whole world had ever used. As she walked about the dark house, she liked to remember what she and Pearl had said once upon a time, remember how painful it could be just to dream. Then, her mind would leap to now and she would touch something, the grandfather clock, the shelves of food in the pantry, the drawer of brassieres still with their price tags, the silver racing bicycle her youngest son was too small to ride.'],\n", " ['\u201cWhat the hell you laughin at, boy?\u201d Rickey said. Clovis, Joyce\u2019s little girl, came up to him and put her hand in his.',\n", "  '\u201cOh, I\u2019ll eat all right,\u201d Santiago said. He took several new bills from his pocket. \u201cNext week, and the week after that, and the one after that, and all the ones after that too.\u201d He stuck some of the money in Rickey\u2019s pocket. \u201cTake a cab to work tomorrow.\u201d',\n", "  '\u201cYou,\u201d Santiago said. \u201cYou look like you don\u2019t know whether to shoot that thing or beg it for another chance.\u201d He put his arm around Rickey\u2019s shoulder, for by then Santiago was a head taller than the man.',\n", "  '\u201cYou think this so damn funny, huh?\u201d Rickey said. \u201cIf I can\u2019t get to work in the mornin, you may not eat next week.\u201d Joyce worked as a home care aide, but it was Rickey\u2019s money that kept the family going.',\n", "  'Before Rickey Madison became a driver and bodyguard for Santiago Moses, he worked construction. The work was steady enough so that at least once a week he could take Joyce and her children to the Flagship on the wharf. One evening two years or so before, they came out of the restaurant and found that Rickey\u2019s Chevy wouldn\u2019t start. Rickey, after spending more than half an hour under the hood, stepped away from the car with resignation and spat into the gutter. Joyce watched him. He was the kind of man who had nightmares about not getting to work on time. Santiago, laughing, made the sign of the cross over the car.'],\n", " ['\u201cGod provides,\u201d Santiago said. \u201cGod is good.\u201d He said to the woman, \u201cAin\u2019t that right, baby?\u201d She sidled up to Santiago and began to giggle. The woman wore a low-cut blue dress and a gold crucifix on a gold chain around her neck, and all through dinner Joyce had looked at the cross resting between the woman\u2019s breasts. \u201cGod is everything,\u201d Santiago said. \u201cGod is good.\u201d',\n", "  'Rickey counted the money, then he counted it twice more, spread it fanlike and turned to show it to Joyce. \u201cLook,\u201d he said to her. \u201cLook at this.\u201d He said to Santiago, \u201cYou hit the number or somethin, boy?\u201d',\n", "  '\u201cPlay money my ass,\u201d Santiago said. He had not come to the restaurant that evening with the rest of the family. And when he did arrive, he was accompanied by a woman who must have been at least ten years older than he. The woman had brought along her son, about three or four years old. \u201cPlay money my ass,\u201d the woman said.',\n", "  'The moment Joyce had seen the woman walk into the restaurant, she knew she would not like her, knew the woman had been doing things with her son. Santiago continued on about God and goodness, and the woman leaned herself and her breasts against him. \u201cNow why don\u2019t you go find a cab so you can take the family home,\u201d Santiago told Rickey. Rickey, without words, went off to look for a cab. \u201cMe and Tamara gon take her car.\u201d The woman\u2019s little boy, looking at Rickey walk away, sat down on the sidewalk with a very loud sigh, as if he thought there would be much more talking and he may as well wait until it was all over.',\n", "  '\u201cIt probably some play money,\u201d Clovis said.'],\n", " ['The boy was still crying. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t love you neither!\u201d he yelled to his mother as she turned the corner, and then he threw the car in her direction. \u201cAnd I never even did.\u201d',\n", "  '\u201cYou tell Sandy he can have him,\u201d the woman said to Joyce. She took one of the boy\u2019s hands and wrapped his fingers around one of the bars. \u201cThis is my settlement for all the money I owe him.\u201d In his other hand, the boy was holding a little car, and leaning against his leg was a small suitcase held together with rope. \u201cYou tell him he can stop buggin me now bout what I owe him. Mark me down paid in full. And tell him to send me a receipt care of General Delivery.\u201d She went clackety-clack down the stairs in her high heels, wobbling the way Joyce had seen Humphrey wobble, and the boy began to cry. \u201cShut up, gotdamnit! Shut up, I said!\u201d She was down the street before Joyce could collect herself to say anything.',\n", "  '\u201cHey! Hey! Wait a minute! Whas goin on here!\u201d Joyce opened the iron-bar door, nearly knocking the boy down the steps. \u201cCome back here!\u201d The woman was nearing O Street. \u201cSweet Jesus,\u201d Joyce said to herself. Had she not been in her bathrobe she would have run after the woman. \u201cWhat are you doin?\u201d',\n", "  'The next time Joyce saw the boy and his mother, it was the day after they had delivered the pool table for the basement in the new house. The woman had reached through the iron-bar door and knocked at the wooden door, and she was about to knock again when Joyce opened the door.',\n", "  'In the cab, Joyce, seeing how happy Rickey was, told the cab driver to take the long way back to their apartment.'],\n", " ['\u201cYou look so tired, baby,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you lay down and let me give you one of my special back rubs?\u201d',\n", "  '\u201cI don\u2019t want nobody\u2019s gotdamn back rub!\u201d',\n", "  '\u201cI guess he must get that kinda need from you, cause he done gone and bought a house in Fort Washington,\u201d Rickey said to Joyce one evening, nearly a year after they had moved into the house. They were in their second-floor bedroom, in their pajamas on the bed, the way Joyce liked to relax with Rickey after her two youngest children were asleep in their beds on the third floor. For a change, Santiago had let him go early. Rickey was leaning back against the headboard and Joyce was lying across the foot of the bed, and in front of her were a beer and her cigarettes and an ashtray on a bamboo tray that could not be tipped over. \u201cI guess he\u2019ll be invitin you and the kids out to see it soon.\u201d This was how she received most of the news about Santiago, in bits and chunks from Rickey when the day was all but over.',\n", "  'When Santiago called that afternoon, he told his mother it would be all right, that the boy would be gone by the evening. \u201cThe dopey bitch just made a mistake, thas all,\u201d he said. But the boy, Adam, stayed three weeks, and no one ever again saw his mother. He was a silent presence in the house and never caused Joyce a moment\u2019s problem. Whatever Joyce told him to do, he did without question or sass. He had retrieved the car the first day, and for all those three weeks, he mostly sat out of the way in a corner of the living room, rolling the car back and forth. The carpet was too thick for the car to move very far on its own, and the boy usually pushed it all the way. Unlike other boys she had known, he did not make car sounds as he moved it. By the time the city government woman had come to get him, Joyce had given him a piece of her heart. The city government woman, who quickly produced a large red sucker as if she expected trouble from Adam, spoke college-people English and double-parked in front of the house. The city government woman took him by the hand, and the boy did not say good-bye and he did not cry. Quite often after that, after Santiago had released Rickey for the night and Joyce had curled up beside him in their bed, she would see Adam in her dreams. But in the dreams he was always a grown man and he would somehow come through the iron bars of one of the basement windows in the dead of night, and when, in the dark, they came upon each other, in the kitchen, on the stairs, in one of the children\u2019s rooms, she did not understand why she was not afraid of him.',\n", "  '\u201cWell, you sure look like you could use one.\u201d When he moved his head, she could see that it was making a greasy spot on the white headboard. She considered what it would take to remove the spot. The day before, he had accidentally dropped a lighted cigarette on the carpet in the hall and she had cursed him for being careless.'],\n", " ['\u201cYou know what I saw last week?\u201d he said. He took a swig from his own beer on the nightstand.',\n", "  '\u201cI thought you was gonna quit them things,\u201d Rickey said. She could tell one of his drunk spells was coming on.',\n", "  'Joyce took a sip of beer and lit another cigarette.',\n", "  'He did not like the way she said that, and at first he thought he would just shut her out and turn over and go to sleep. But soon he said, \u201cI saw the most money I ever seen in my whole life.\u201d He suppressed a belch. He squinted, gazed at the bedspread as if the memory of the money were now a scene unfolding in the spread\u2019s pattern of palm trees and sand and birds in flight. \u201cAnd it was in a room with a few kids that couldn\u2019t a been no more than thirteen, fourteen years old. They was playin this big radio that was sittin in the windowsill and they all knew the songs that was playin on the radio, and every time a song came on they would sing along, like they was at camp or somethin. They were at this big round table, countin that money and laughin and havin all the fun in the world like they were just countin so many leaves and it wouldn\u2019t be anything if it all blew away.\u201d He yawned. \u201cSo much money that it musta been some kinda sin just to have it at one time in a place that wasn\u2019t a bank. Some house in Northeast, maybe it was Southwest. One place is gettin to be like another now. \u2018Drive me here, Rickey.\u2019 \u2018Drive me there, Rickey.\u2019\u201d',\n", "  '\u201cNo, baby, what did you see last week?\u201d'],\n", " ['\u201cYou member: I told you the first of the month. Don\u2019t you remember? I promise.\u201d She could tell he didn\u2019t believe her.',\n", "  '\u201cYou got your own.\u201d She lit another cigarette. \u201cRickey, why you gotta always bring that stuff home? Those people don\u2019t interest me in the least. I thought we was gonna have a nice evenin, just me and you, baby.\u201d She was afraid he might start pouting, as he now did more and more when he was drunk, and to head him off, she pushed the tray out of the way and crawled up the bed and put her arms around him. \u201cAll right,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. So this was the one himself, huh?\u201d',\n", "  'Rickey said: \u201cAll the men there ever was in my family, that\u2019ll ever be in my family, each one could work day and night for a thousand years, and all the money they would make would never come close to what I saw in that room. I can still hear some a those songs that was on the radio, and I can tell you some a the words.\u201d He sang one of the songs.',\n", "  'He yawned again, then inspected his fingernails and slid farther down in the bed. \u201cI forgot to tell you that day fore yesterday I finally got a look at this Smokey Peebles. Himself. The William \u2018Smokey\u2019 Peebles everybody talks about. After all this time, I guess Sandy trust me enough.\u201d Despite Joyce\u2019s pleadings, he refused to wear the silk pajamas she bought for him. The cotton and synthetic ones, he told her, didn\u2019t let him slide off the bed as the silk ones did. \u201cGimme a sip.\u201d He reached for Joyce\u2019s beer.',\n", "  '\u201cYou ready for that back rub now, sugar?\u201d'],\n", " ['He was silent for a long time and she reached into his underwear and stroked him.',\n", "  'Rickey said, \u201cSandy had me drive him to this place off Florida Avenue, to some kinda old-fashioned drug store. But they didn\u2019t have a pharmacy or nothin like that. It was mostly just a soda fountain and some booths. A few tables and chairs, just like in those old black-and-white movies.\u201d She put her hand inside the shirt of his pajamas and stroked his chest; sometimes there was nothing to do but ride the whole thing out.',\n", "  '\u201cNot right now,\u201d he said, taking her hand out. \u201cBesides it don\u2019t seem to be doin the job anyway.\u201d',\n", "  '\u201cI could tell that Sandy\u2019d been there before, just from the way he gave me directions,\u201d Rickey said. \u201cWhen they let us in, Sandy goes to the counter and sits down beside this little boy, who was drinkin a milkshake all slurpy-loud and everything. I stood near the big front window, just like he told me to. There was two men I\u2019d seen someplace else before standin near the front door, and there was a large man in one of the booths sittin across from this very pretty woman who was drinkin a big milkshake just like the little boy. This big fella had on the best-lookin suit I\u2019d ever seen, the kinda suit I want you to bury me in when I pop off. Sandy was steady-talkin to this little boy and I just kept lookin at Smokey, at that big back a his. It made me nervous at first to be near somebody they say had killed three men. The woman he was talkin to had on a lot of makeup and she was more interested in the milkshake than whatever it was Smokey was sayin to her.\u201d',\n", "  '\u201cYou gotta be patient,\u201d Joyce said. \u201cThas the thing bout makin babies.

Can I call you Smokey?\u2019\u201d',\n", "  'Rickey smiled. He said, \u201cThere was an old white man in a nice clean apron behind the fountain and he had one a those old-timey soda jerk hats on. He held up one a those metal glasses they useta make milkshakes in and he shook it at me, wantin to know if I wanted one. I shook my head. There wasn\u2019t nobody else in the place but these people, and no aisles with soap and toothpaste and aspirin and whatnot, and I gradually got the feelin that this white man\u2019s one job in life was to make milkshakes and banana splits and everything for whoever big Smokey told him to.\u201d',\n", "  'The grandfather clock in the hall downstairs struck ten, and Joyce lifted her head momentarily from Rickey\u2019s chest to listen for Clovis getting up and going to the bathroom.',\n", "  'Rickey reached over and drank the last of his beer in one swig. \u201cI think he musta been twenty-five or somethin like that, and all he was talkin about was those damn tennis shoes.

She had on high heels and big earrings and a short dress and a painted face that made you wanna cry. She moved like every move she had learned by practicin, like maybe she\u2019d studied how to move like a real woman while standin in front a some big mirror.

He came toward the door and everybody jumped up, includin Sandy. One a those guys opened the door. The boy stuck out his hand to me, and I could see that he wasn\u2019t a boy atall. \u2018You Rickey, huh?\u2019 he said. \u2018I\u2019m Smokey. Smokey Peebles. You keep watchin out for my boy there.

If you saw those tennis shoes like from a mile away you\u2019d think they were Chuck Taylors, but up close, even a blind man could tell you they was just imitation. And people, my own friends now, got on my shit about it too, stomped all over my feelins.

As always, Joyce tried to anticipate all that her mother would throw at her and spent the walk down to her mother\u2019s thinking of ways to counter it. She would not have noticed the woman and the three children walking down the other side of 5th Street had the little girl with the woman not cried out to one of the boys, \u201cStop, you hurtin my sore!\u201d When Joyce looked over, she saw the woman scolding the youngest of the boys, shaking her finger in his face.

There was always an empty space she saved for some especially wonderful picture that might come along. That space shifted about, according to how she arranged things. On the day Rickey asked her about the pill, the space happened to be next to a picture of her in a white-and-green cotton print dress, and she was standing beside the man who was Clovis\u2019s father. The photograph had been taken a year or so before she met Rickey, and a month after her tubes were tied. \u201cI hope he tied the knot tight enough,\u201d Joyce said to one of the hospital nurses who had befriended her.\u201d \u201cA pretty bow,\u201d the nurse said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the few things they get right in this joint.\u201d'],\n", " ['\u201cThas my child, lady, leave him be,\u201d the woman said.',\n", "  '\u201cI don\u2019t let my children take money from strangers off the street,\u201d the woman said.',\n", "  '\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Joyce said. \u201cMe and Adam know each other from way back, don\u2019t we, Adam?\u201d The boy shook his head. \u201cSure you do,\u201d Joyce said. \u201cCome on now, think.

In that second-floor bedroom in her 10th Street house she had set aside for her mother, there was a telephone with giant numbers so her mother would not have trouble dialing her friends.

At a shoe store near 13th Street, she abandoned once and for all any hope she ever had that her mother would come to live with her and spend the rest of her life in the room on the second floor.

Anita closed her eyes for a few seconds and began to sing as she always did\u2014for God and for her father. Once, as she was singing at the Virgin Mother Baptist Church on Kentucky Avenue, Jesus had come down the aisle and sat down in a pew near the front. He told her that her voice pleased him. He had said no more than that, but she had taken his words to mean that he forgave her for living with John without marriage. And each time she saw her father, who would not forgive her, she wanted to tell him what Jesus had done and said. But she could not create the words. Perhaps the words were in the music, but it did no good, because her father did not come anymore to hear her sing.',\n", "  'The Gospelteers opened with \u201cConsideration\u201d:'],\n", " ['Mad winds may blow; mad breakers roar',\n", "  'They beat on every side',\n", "  'When it was all over, they had a bite to eat at the church, mingling with those who could not get enough of hearing and talking about the old man.

Outside, they hugged Counsel good night, and the four women set off in Vivian\u2019s car. It had been snowing, and each of the four was full of the satisfying warmth at knowing the evening had gone so well.

And in that instant before the light went out, she saw Diane and the man lean toward each other.

The young women\u2019s cotton print dresses billowed slightly with the summer breezes, and even the billowing itself seemed to a little girl a part of all the secrets and romance that she could not yet take part in. And the young women always leaned back against the shadiest of trees with such utter self-assurance, holding a glass of lemonade that the men had brought out from the kitchen. And when the young women\u2019s parents thought that there was too much in the giggles, they would tell the women to come up to the porch and bring so-and-so and get some more lemonade.',\n", "  'Where had all such men gone when she herself came of age?

For ten years he had been the chief engineer at the Sheraton Park Hotel, where practically every employee knew his name. For longer than he could recall, his friends and lodge members had been telling him that he was capable of being more than just the number-one maintenance man. But he always told them that he was contented in the job, that it was all he needed, and this was true for the most part.

And that tie he had on was one that I give him too. I thought I would miss him but I do not miss him very much. Checkers was never Buddy Wilsons game.\u201d As he read, he massaged the area around his heart, an old habit, something he did even when his heart was not giving him trouble. \u201cI hope you and the family can come down before the winter months set in.

He could picture his father sitting at the kitchen table, writing the letter, occasionally touching the pencil point to his tongue. A new mongrel\u2019s head would be resting across his lap, across thin legs that could still carry the old man five miles down the road and back. Woodrow, feeling better, considered returning to work, but he knew his heart was deceitful. He folded the envelope and stuck it in his back pocket, and out of the pocket it would fall late that night as he prepared for bed after returning from the police station.',\n", "  'He did not listen to her, because he had found that she lived to lie. Woodrow watched the boys as they took their time straightening themselves up, and he knew that their deliberateness was the result of something his daughter had said about him. Without taking his eyes from the boys, he asked his daughter again why she wasn\u2019t in school. When he finally looked at her, he saw that she was holding the stump of a thin cigarette. The smoke he smelled was unfamiliar, and at first he thought that they were smoking very stale cigarettes, or cigarettes that had gotten wet and been dried. He slapped her. \u201cI told you not to smoke in my house,\u201d he said.',\n", "  '\u201cThey let us out early today,\u201d she said. \u201cThe teachers had some kinda meetin.\u201d',\n", "  'Several feet before he reached his apartment door he could hear the boys\u2019 laughter and bits and pieces of their man-child conquer-the-world talk. He could not hear his daughter at first. He stopped at his door and listened for nearly five minutes, and in that time he became so fascinated by what the boys were saying that he would not have cared if someone walking in the hall found him listening. It was only when he heard his daughter\u2019s laughter, familiar, known, that he put his key in the door. She stood just inside the door when he entered, her eyes accusing but her mouth set in a small O of surprise. Beyond her he could see the boys with their legs draped over the arms of the couch and gray smoke above their heads wafting toward the open window.'],\n", " ['She was fifteen, and up until six months or so before, she would have collapsed into the chair, collapsed into a fit of crying.

The boy\u2019s eyes widened and Woodrow shook him some more. He had been living a black man\u2019s civilized life in Washington and had not felt so coiled and bristled since the days when he worked with wild men in the turpentine camps in Florida. \u201cI ain\u2019t done nothin,\u201d the boy said. The words sounded familiar, similar to those of a wild man ready to slink away into his cabin with his tail between his legs. Woodrow relaxed. \u201cI swear. I don\u2019t want no trouble, Mr. Cunningham.\u201d The boy had no other smell but that peculiar cigarette smoke, and it was a shock to Woodrow that a body with that smell should know something that seemed as personal as his name. The other, smaller boy had tiptoed around Woodrow and was having trouble opening the door. After the small boy had gone out, Woodrow flung the light-skinned boy out behind him.

And in the beginning, the very size of the city lifted her spirits, for in a place so big, there was certainly a spot that held something as small as her child, and if they just kept looking long enough, they would come upon that place.',\n", "  'Before they had coffee later that morning, about seven thirty, they called their jobs to say they would not be in. Work had always occupied a place at the center of their lives, and there was initially something eerie about being home when it was not a holiday or the weekend. They spent the rest of the morning searching the streets together, and in the afternoon, they separated to cover more ground. They did the same thing after dinner, each spreading out farther and farther from their apartment on R Street. That evening, they called neighbors and friends, church and lodge members, to tell them that their child was missing and that they needed their help and their prayers. Their friends and neighbors began searching that evening, and a few went with Woodrow and Rita the next day to the police station to file a missing person\u2019s report. A different sergeant was at the desk, and though he was a white man, Woodrow felt that he understood their trouble.',\n", "  'They waited up until about four in the morning, and then they undressed without words in the dark. Rita began to cry the moment her head hit the pillow, for she was afraid to see the sun come up and find that a new day had arrived without Elaine being home. She asked him again what happened, and he told her again, even things that he had forgotten\u2014the logo of the football team on the light-skinned boy\u2019s jacket, the fact that the other boy was bald except for a half-dollar-sized spot of hair carved on the back of his head. He was still talking when she dozed off with him holding her.',\n", "  'For nearly three months, Woodrow and Rita searched after they came from work, and each evening after they and their friends had been out, the pastor of Rising Star spoke to a small group that gathered in the Cunninghams\u2019 living room. \u201cThe world is cold and not hospitable,\u201d he would conclude, holding his hat in both hands, \u201cbut we know our God to be a kind God and that he has provided our little sister with a place of comfort and warmth until she returns to her parents and to all of us who love and treasure her.\u201d',\n", "  '\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Rita would ask as they prepared for bed. What he told her and her listening replaced everything they had ever done in that bed\u2014discussing what future they wanted for Elaine, lovemaking, sharing what the world had done to them that workday. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d It was just about the only thing she ever asked Woodrow as the months grew colder. \u201cWhat happened? Whatcha say to her?\u201d By late February, when fewer and fewer people were going out to search, he had told the whole story, but then he began to tell her things that had not happened. There were three boys, he said at one point, for example. Or, he could see a gun sticking out of the jacket pocket of the light-skinned one, and he could see the outline of a knife in the back pants pocket of the third. Or he would say that the record player was playing so loudly he could hear it from the street. They were small embellishments at first, and if his wife noticed that the story of what happened was changing, she said nothing. In time, with winter disappearing, he was adding more and more so that it was no longer a falseness here and there that was embedded in the whole of the truth, but the truth itself, an ever-diminishing kernel, that was contained in the whole of falseness. And, like some kind of bedtime story, she listened and drifted with his words into a sleep where the things he was telling her were sometimes happening.'],\n", " ['\u201cYou keep telling me that I\u2019ll be hurt or lost,\u201d the old man wrote Woodrow. \u201cBut I know the way that Washington, D.C. is set up. I came there once maybe twice. How could I get lost. Take a chance on me, and we\u2019ll have that child home before you can blink one eye. I can bring Sparky he got some bloodhound in him.\u201d',\n", "  'By March, Woodrow had written countless letters to his father telling the old man it was not necessary to come to Washington to help look for the girl. \u201cI got a sign from God,\u201d the old man kept writing, \u201cthat I could help find her.\u201d Then, with spring, he began writing that he had received signs that he was not long for the world, that finding the girl was the last thing God wanted him to do. In the longest letters the old man had ever written to the one child of his who responded, he would go on and on about the signs he saw signaling his own death: The mongrel would no longer take food from his hand; the dead visited him at night, sitting down on the side of his bed and telling him things about himself; the rising sun now touched his house last in the morning, though there were houses to the left and right of his.',\n", "  'In late April, Rita took down the map in the kitchen. The tacks fell to the floor and she left them there. She put the map in the bottom drawer of her daughter\u2019s dresser, among the blouses and blue jeans and a diary she would not find the strength to read for another three months. Her days of searching during the week dwindled down to two, then to one. She returned the car a church member had lent her to drive around the city in. Each evening when she got home, Woodrow would be out and she left his dinner in the oven to stay warm. Every now and again, when the hour was late, she went out to look for him, often for no other reason than that there was nothing worth watching on the television. As she put on more and more weight, it became difficult for her to stand and dish out food to the students at lunchtime. Her supervisor and fellow workers sympathized, and, after a week of perfunctory training, she was allowed to sit and work at the cash register.',\n", "  'As he continued going about the city, sometimes on foot, Woodrow told himself and everyone else that he was hunting for his daughter, but this was only a piece of the truth. \u201cI\u2019m lookin for my daughter, who\u2019s run away,\u201d he said to those opening the doors where he knocked. \u201cShe\u2019s been gone a long time, and her mama and me are about to lose our minds.\u201d He sometimes presented a picture of his daughter, smiling radiantly, that was taken only months before she disappeared. But just as often, he would pull out a photograph of the girl when she was five, standing one Easter between her parents in front of Rising Star. All who looked at the photograph, even the drunks half-blind with alcohol, were touched by the picture of the little girl in her Easter dress who had now gone away from her parents, parents who were now worried sick. Many people invited Woodrow into their homes.',\n", "  'The Easter picture became a passport, and the more places he visited the more places he wanted to see. On U Street, a woman of twenty-five or so with three children put down the child she was holding to get a better look at the picture of the five-year-old girl. Woodrow, in the doorway, noted just over her shoulder that on her wall there was a calendar with a snow-covered mountain, hung with the prominence others would have given a landscape painting. An old woman on Harvard Street, tsk-tsking as she looked at the picture, invited him in for coffee and cake. \u201cMy prayers go out to you.\u201d Nearly everything in her apartment was covered in plastic, even the pictures on the walls. The old woman sat him on her plastic-covered couch and placed the food on a coffee table covered with a plastic cloth. \u201cAnd such a sweet-lookin child, too, son.\u201d When he asked to use the bathroom (more out of curiosity than for relief), she pointed to a plastic path leading away down the hall. \u201cStay on the mat, son.\u201d'],\n", " ['A tottering man in a place on 21st Street just off Benning Road began to cry when Woodrow told him his story. \u201cDora, Dora,\u201d the man called to a woman. \u201cCome see this little angel.\u201d The woman, who was also tottering, pulled Woodrow into their house with one hand, while the other hand pressed the picture to her bosom. The man and Woodrow sat on the couch. The woman stood in front of them, swaying trancelike, her eyes closed, the picture still pressed to her. The man put his arm around Woodrow and breathed a sour wine smell into his face. \u201cLet\u2019s me and you pray about this situation,\u201d he said.',\n", "  'Though he was younger than three other brothers, Woodrow had worked hardest of his father\u2019s children. At first, his father had sat his children about the supper table according to their ages, but then he began to seat them according to who did the most work. His best workers sat closest to him, and by the time he was seven, Woodrow had worked his way to the right hand of his father. Woodrow\u2019s mother sat at the far end of the table, between two of her daughters. Most of his brothers and sisters, unable to pick the amount of cotton Woodrow could, never forgave him for living only to be close to their father. But he learned to pay them no mind and even learned to enjoy their hostility. He never moved from that right-hand place until the day he went off down the road to work in the turpentine camps.',\n", "  'There was not much in the old man\u2019s place to divide among his heirs. In a wooden trunk in one of the back rooms, Woodrow found several pictures of his mother. He had been kneeling down, going through the trunk, and when he saw the pictures, he cried out as if he had been struck. He had not seen his mother\u2019s face in more than forty years, had thought his father had destroyed all the pictures of her. \u201cYou always looked like her,\u201d Alice said, coming up behind him. \u201cEven when you sat at the right hand of the father, you looked like her.\u201d',\n", "  'Woodrow\u2019s father died nearly seven years after Elaine Cunningham disappeared. Of the eight children he had had with Woodrow\u2019s mother and the five he had had with other women, only Woodrow, Alice, and a half-brother who lived down the road from the old man came to the funeral. It was a frozen day in January, and the gravediggers broke two picks before they had even gone down one foot. They labored seven hours to make a hole for the old man. \u201cEven the ground don\u2019t want him,\u201d said one of the old man\u2019s friends standing at the gravesite.',\n", "  'One April evening, a little more than a year and a half after their daughter disappeared, Rita was standing in front of their building, waiting for him. \u201cWe have fish tonight. It\u2019s in the stove waitin,\u201d she said, in the same way she would have said, \u201cI know what you been doin. And who you been doin it with.\u201d \u201cWe have fish to eat,\u201d she said again. She turned around and went back inside. \u201cWe have fish, and we have to move from this place,\u201d she said.'],\n", " ['He also found in the trunk some letters he wrote his father from the camps and from railroad yards and from the places he worked as he made his way up to Washington. They were all of one page or less, and they were all about work, work from sunup to sundown. There were no friends mentioned, there were no descriptions of places where he lived, there were no names of women courted, loved. \u201cI got a two-week job tanning hides,\u201d he wrote from a nameless place in South Carolina. \u201cI got work cureing tobacco. I may stay on after the season,\u201d he wrote from somewhere near Raleigh. \u201cI have been working in the stables outside Charlotesvile. The pay is good. I got used to the smell. and the work goes easy.\u201d',\n", "  'Woodrow and Rita took the train back to Washington, bringing back a few of the pictures and none of the letters, which he burned in a barrel outside his father\u2019s house. Everything along the way back to D.C. was as frozen as Georgia. It was as if the cold had separated the world into three unrelated and distinct parts\u2014the earth, what was on the earth, and the sky above. Nothing moved. Flying birds seemed to freeze in midair, and then the cold would nail them there.',\n", "  'Woodrow, even though the hour was late and the weather people were predicting even colder temperatures, quietly put on his heaviest coat and left the apartment. He said nothing to Rita, and she did not look up when the door locked behind him. At the corner of Independence and 15th, Woodrow looked into the grocery store window at the owner he had become friends with since moving to Southeast. No customers went into the store, and the owner was dozing behind the counter, his head back, his mouth open. Woodrow watched him for a very long time. By now he knew everything about the man and his store and the sons who helped the man, and there was no urgency to be inside with him. Having lost so much weight, Woodrow felt that even more of the world had opened up to him. And so he wondered if he should go on down 15th Street, try to find a house he had not visited before, and bring out the picture of the child in her Easter dress.',\n", "  'Rita and Woodrow were back in the apartment on Independence Avenue in Southeast by ten o\u2019clock that night. Rita took her usual place at an easy chair near the window. On a table beside the chair was all she needed\u2014the television guide, snacks, the telephone. The chair was very large and had had to be specially ordered, because she could not fit into the regular ones in the store.',\n", "  'A DARK NIGHT'],\n", " ['It began to rain, no more than a soft tapping at the window.',\n", "  'They heard an apartment door down the long hall to the right open and close with utter violence, obviously pushed shut by the wind of the storm. Within seconds, they saw Ida Garrett move almost soundlessly past Carmena Boone\u2019s open door, a rubber-tipped brown cane in her good hand. She went the few yards to the end of the hall on the left and knocked again and again and again at what everyone in the room knew was the door of Beatrice Atwell\u2019s apartment. Beatrice was sitting in the middle of Carmena\u2019s couch, snug between the large Frazier sisters from the fifth floor. Then, just as soundlessly, Mrs. Garrett was standing small and silent in Boone\u2019s doorway. She could not have looked any more forlorn if she had been out in the storm: breathing as if each breath would be her last, her wig perched haphazardly on her head as if it had been dropped from the ceiling by accident, her pocketbook hanging from the arm that a stroke had permanently folded against her body, her eyeglasses resting near the end of her nose, beyond where they could possibly do her any good.',\n", "  'About four that afternoon the thunder and lightning began again. The four women seated about Carmena Boone\u2019s efficiency apartment grew still and spoke in whispers, when they spoke at all: They were each of them no longer young, and they had all been raised to believe that such weather was\u2014aside from answered prayers\u2014the closest thing to the voice of God. And so each in her way listened.',\n", "  '\u201cI was passin,\u201d she said with effort to Carmena, \u201cand I saw your door was open.\u201d Leaning against the doorjamb, she blinked in an effort to adjust to a room that was lit by only a forty-watt bulb, another concession to the voice of God. Several times, she shifted the scarred cane from the good hand to the bad, and just when the bad hand seemed about to drop it, she would take it back. \u201cI was passin and saw your door was open, Boone\u2026.\u201d',\n", "  'She continued to repeat herself until Carmena stood and went to her, reassured Mrs. Garrett with a light touch of the hand. \u201cYou know you always welcome here, Miss Garrett.\u201d She took the woman\u2019s elbow and led her to a chair at the dining table. \u201cI was thinkin bout you, me and the Fraziers, but somebody said you\u2019d been under the weather, so I thought I shouldn\u2019t bother you.\u201d'],\n", " ['\u201cI\u2019m fine, by the help of the Lord,\u201d Mrs. Garrett said, sitting. She settled herself, patting her wig and making sure her dress was well down over her knees. Her movements seemed practiced, like those of someone who did everything according to the way it was set out in some book. She placed her cane across her lap and leisurely began to pick pieces of lint off her dress, a silklike, polka-dotted thing that shimmered with what seemed huge green eyes. Then, with a flash of lightning and burst of thunder, she jerked her head up, as if the whole thing had been directed at her personally, the thunder an inch from her ear and the lightning just in front of her eyes. She waited, and when there was quiet for several minutes, she sighed, then began to take note of the four other women. They had been watching her intently, but when she looked at them, they nodded and lowered their eyes or deftly turned their heads away. Only when they were addressed by name did the women look at her, smile, ask how she was keeping. Beatrice, knitting on the couch between the Frazier sisters, did not look up.',\n", "  '\u201cNo,\u201d Beatrice said happily. \u201cI\u2019m here. I\u2019m right here.\u201d It seemed to give her so much pleasure to say these words that she repeated them again and again until she raised a thread to her mouth and bit it in two. \u201cI\u2019ve come for the prayer meetin.\u201d',\n", "  'Carmena, seeking support, glanced at the others. \u201cIt\u2019s him. But he got a church of his own now, Miss Garrett. Out in Northwest, just off Rhode Island Avenue.\u201d',\n", "  '\u201cSo thas what all yall hens here for?\u201d Mrs. Garrett said and turned to Carmena at the other end of the table. Carmena nodded with a smile. \u201cOh, but I hope yall ain\u2019t gonna have that Reverend Sawyer again. He ain\u2019t nothin but jackleg, Boone. I could tell the first time I laid eyes on him. \u2018Jackleg,\u2019 I said to myself. \u2018As jackleg as they come.\u2019\u201d',\n", "  '\u201cI\u2019m surprised to see you here,\u201d Mrs. Garrett said to her. \u201cI thought you might be home.\u201d There was a bit of hurt to the last words.'],\n", " ['\u201cHe said three thirty,\u201d Carmena said.',\n", "  '\u201cHavin a church, Boone, don\u2019t mount to a hill of beans,\u201d Mrs. Garrett said with exasperation. \u201cIt don\u2019t make a man a preacher, called by God. Even I\u201d\u2014she put her good hand over her heart\u2014\u201ccould say I\u2019m a man a God, but that don\u2019t make it so.

And I ain\u2019t never give him money to come here to pray with us.\u201d Mrs. Garrett smiled knowingly. \u201cI do have some food for us all when he get here. But thas a everyday normal courtesy. Some sandwiches\u2026some cake and punch\u2026just things I picked up round the corner\u2026whatn\u2019t no trouble\u2026.\u201d'],\n", " ['\u201cSewin,\u201d Beatrice said. \u201cMakin somethin for my new grandchild.\u201d',\n", "  '\u201cAnd what you doin over there, Atwell, workin away like a tiny little mouse?\u201d Mrs. Garrett said.',\n", "  '\u201cOh, Lani dropped another one, huh?

A little over a month ago.\u201d The two Frazier sisters on either side of Beatrice were tall women, each weighing about 200 pounds, and they seemed to spread out much more than when they were standing. Beatrice weighed little more than 110 pounds, and if there had been no words from her, she might well have gone unnoticed.',\n", "  'Carmena shut the window just as the rain began to come in. With only the forty-watt burning in the lamp on the table, the room was on the verge of darkness. But each flash of lightning would give a ghastly brightness to the place and for those moments everything in the room could be clearly seen.'],\n", " ['Silent and still except for the motions of her hands, Beatrice never looked up.',\n", "  '\u201cAnd you never told me,\u201d Mrs. Garrett said. \u201cTsk tsk tsk. I always thought well of Lani.\u201d She turned slowly to Carmena, and as she turned, her smiled widened. \u201cBut that husband of Lani\u2019s keeps her havin babies. Who can keep up with how many they have? She\u2019s the babiest-havin woman I ever knowed of. One after the other after the other\u2026.\u201d',\n", "  'Once the women were seated again, the conversation took varied turns, and the autumn evening wore away. Mrs. Garrett, perhaps dulled by the food, had less to say than anyone. At one point, the Frazier sister nearest the window commented on how particularly bad the weather had been lately. They all agreed, and Mrs. Garrett, capping one hand over her knee, said that she could not remember when Old Man Arthur and the Ritis boys had caused her so much pain, that sometimes she felt she would never walk again. The other women gave sympathetic nods, one or two mentioning their own aches and pains, and then they all began to exchange remedies. Beatrice stuck her needle with finality into the piece she was working on and put it in a cloth bag at her feet. Looking about the room, she said quietly, \u201cIt all reminds me of one summer back home. It was kinda like it is now, day after day.\u201d',\n", "  'Carmena prayed for the Reverend Sawyer to turn up. If nothing stopped her, Mrs. Garrett would sit in that chair and rain down devilment all day and all night and all day some more. Carmena thought it had to do with her being ninety-one years old and thinking she was closer to God than any human being in the world. Mrs. Garrett and Beatrice had once been so close that people joked they would be buried together in the same casket. Now Mrs. Garrett was forever after Beatrice as if the final task standing between her and the key to heaven was to make Beatrice suffer. Beatrice, however, treated Mrs. Garrett as she would a child who didn\u2019t know any better.',\n", "  'Toward five thirty, not long after Mrs. Garrett had asked again what time the Reverend Doctor Sawyer was supposed to arrive, the telephone rang. Carmena answered and spoke but a few words before hanging up. She announced that it had been Reverend Sawyer\u2019s wife, that his car would not start and that he apologized to everyone for not being able to make the prayer meeting. Waving her hand over the table, she told her guests that there was no need to let the food go to waste, and one by one the women got up and helped themselves. The storm, the thunder and lightning, had stopped, but there was still the rain, a nuisance scratching at the window.'],\n", " ['Beatrice said nothing for several seconds. \u201cIt thundered and lightened a lot then, too,\u201d she said. \u201cI guess I was sixteen or seventeen and this fella I was keepin company with was sittin with me and my daddy on my daddy\u2019s porch. There was a storm comin on while we were sittin there. There had already been a lotta rain, but not anough to do that much damage to the crops. I remember it was late in the evenin and so dark I could barely make out what was three feet in front a me. It was already rainin when the thunder and lightnin come up, and we was just sittin and talkin.',\n", "  '\u201cMaybe a half hour or more into that storm, I started seein this figure, this thing, that kinda just stood in that corn patch in my mother\u2019s garden. If I didn\u2019t know the garden, I woulda thought it was a scarecrow or somethin. It was no further than from here to that television there. I looked and looked, tryin to see into all that dark, and then I told myself it was just a big corn stalk leanin out heavy with the rain. It made a move a corn stalk ain\u2019t supposed to make but I tried not to think about it. \u2018It\u2019s corn,\u2019 I said to myself. But when this thing moved again\u2014moved different from all the other corn\u2014I said this real quiet \u2018Oh.\u2019 I touched the fella I was keepin company with and pointed and we looked together. My daddy looked, too. This corn stalk, this thing, said, \u2018Uncle\u2026Uncle\u2026Bea\u2026\u2019 Then it moved a few steps toward us. It was this cousin a mine, John Henry. He came even closer and just dropped heavy to the ground, cryin like a baby.',\n", "  '\u201cI said, \u2018John Henry, whas wrong? What is it?\u2019 My daddy was already gettin up. \u2018It\u2019s them,\u2019 he said. He was cryin so hard that I could barely make out what he was sayin. \u2018It\u2019s them,\u2019 he kept sayin. \u2018They just sittin there.\u2019',\n", "  '\u201cHow, Bea?\u201d Carmena said, ignoring Mrs. Garrett. \u201cHow does this remind you of back home?\u201d Mrs. Garrett rubbed the elbow of her bad arm, then put the bad hand in the center of her lap.',\n", "  '\u201cOh, now, Atwell, we ain\u2019t gonna have one a your down-home, way-back-when stories, are we?\u201d Mrs. Garrett said. \u201cWe ain\u2019t had a evenin of prayer, but we been tryin to keep it as close to that as we can.\u201d'],\n", " ['\u201cMy daddy went down the steps to him, and when he touched John Henry, John Henry just jumped right up, real quick, like he was some doll and somethin had pulled him up by the neck. He took off down the path that led from his place to where we lived. The three of us\u2014my daddy, me and this fella I was keepin company with\u2014took off after him. It was rainin way harder than it is right now and we was soaked through fore we even took a few steps.

This long black line that had cut a rut in the floor went from the fireplace through that group a people right out the room to the kitchen\u2014like somebody had took a big fireball of barbed wire and run cross the floor with it.',\n", "  '\u201cThey was just sittin there and they was all gone. You could see where Aunt Ebbie\u2019s mother had been rockin the crib with Aunt Ebbie\u2019s baby in it. A wind was coming down the chimney and through the door, and it was rockin the crib, rockin Aunt Ebbie\u2019s mother\u2019s hand right along with it. I thought the baby was dead, too, but when I saw a leg twitch, I knowed he was alive. I picked him up and he didn\u2019t look surprised to see me, he didn\u2019t look happy or sad or anything. Just a baby waiting for the next thing in his life to happen. I put Aunt Ebbie\u2019s mother\u2019s hand in her lap. I did it calm-like and I was surprised at myself, the way I was actin. I musta been scared somewhere inside, but it was a long time before I knowed it. And then it stayed and never went away.',\n", "  '\u201cWhen we got to the house, John Henry was there lookin in the front door. \u2018John Henry,\u2019 my daddy said, \u2018John Henry.\u2019 We got there and looked in too. Everybody was just sittin around like he had said. My Uncle Joe, his wife Ebbie, her mother, and my Uncle Ray. There was a pipe stickin in Uncle Ray\u2019s mouth, not lit, just stickin there like he did sometimes.

He had never stopped rising each morning before Betsy Ann and going out to the coop to see what pigeons might have died in the night. And that was what he did that last morning in midautumn. He touched down onto the roof and discovered it had snowed during the night. A light, nuisance powder, not thick enough to cover the world completely and make things beautiful the way he liked. Though there was enough sunlight, he did not at first notice the tiny tracks, with even tinier, intermittent spots of blood, leading from the coop, across his roof and over to the roof of the house next door, the schoolteacher\u2019s house that had been empty for more than four months. He did, however, hear the birds squawking before he reached the coop, but this meant nothing to him, because one pigeon sound was more or less like another to him.\\n',\n", " '\\n',\n", " 'The night before there had been sixteen pigeons of various ages, but when he reached the coop, five were already dead and three were in their last moments, dragging themselves crazily about the floor or from side to side in the lower cubicles. Six of them he would kill with his own hands. Though there were bodies with holes so deep he saw white flesh, essence, it was the sight of dozens of detached feathers that caused his body to shake, because the scattered feathers, more than the wrecked bodies, spoke to him of helplessness. He closed his eyes as tight as he could and began to pray, and when he opened them, the morning was even brighter.\\n',\n", " '\\n',\n", " 'He looked back at the window, for something had whispered that Betsy Ann was watching. But he was alone and he went into the coop. He took up one dead bird whose left wing and legs had been chewed off; he shook the bird gently, and gently he blew into its face. He prayed once more. The pigeons that were able had moved to the farthest corner of the coop and they watched him, quivering. He knew now that the squawking was the sound of pain and it drove him out of their house.\\n',\n", " '\\n',\n", " 'When he saw the tracks, he realized immediately that they had been made by rats. He bent down, and some logical piece of his mind was surprised that there was a kind of orderliness to the trail, even with its ragged bits of pigeon life, a fragment of feather here, a spot of blood there.\\n',\n", " '\\n',\n", " 'He did not knock at Walter and Miss Jenny\u2019s door and wait to go in, as he had done each morning for some thirteen years. He found them at the breakfast table, and because they had been used to thirteen years of knocking, they looked up at him, amazed. Most of his words were garbled, but they followed him back upstairs. Betsy Ann had heard the noise of her father coming through the kitchen window and bounded down the stairs.

From inside, she had heard the squawking, a brand new sound for her. Even with Walter holding her, she got a few feet from the coop. And when Robert told her to go back inside, she gave him the only no of their lives. He looked but once at her and then began to wring the necks of the birds injured beyond all hope. Strangely, when he reached for them, the pigeons did not peck, did not resist. He placed all of the bodies in the sacks, and when he was all done and stood covered in blood and viscera and feathers, he began to cry.\\n',\n", " '\\n',\n", " 'Betsy Ann and her father noticed almost simultaneously that there were two birds completely unharmed, huddled in an upper corner of the coop. After he tied the mouths of the sacks, the two birds, as if of one mind, flew together to the landing board and from there to the oak tree in Miss Jenny\u2019s yard. Then they were gone.

In school, her mind would wander and she would doodle so many pigeons on the backs of her hands and along her arms that teachers called her Nasty, nasty girl. In the bathtub at night, she would cry to have to wash them off. And as she slept, missing them would take shape and lean down over her bed and wake her just enough to get her to understand a whisper that told her all over again how much she missed them. And when she raged in her sleep, Robert would come in and hold her until she returned to peace. He would sit in a chair beside her bed for the rest of the night, for her rages usually came about four in the morning and with the night so near morning, he saw no use in going back to bed.\\n',\n", " '\\n',\n", " 'She roamed the city at will, and Robert said nothing. She came to know the city so well that had she been blindfolded and taken to practically any place in Washington, even as far away as Anacostia or Georgetown, she could have taken off the blindfold and walked home without a moment\u2019s trouble. Her favorite place became the library park at Mount Vernon Square, the same park where Miss Jenny had first seen Robert and Clara together, across the street from the Peoples where Betsy Ann had been caught stealing. And there on some warm days Robert would find her, sitting on a bench, or lying on the grass, eyes to the sky.\\n',\n", " '\\n',\n", " 'For many weeks, well into winter, one of the birds that had not been harmed would come to the ledge of a back window of an abandoned house that faced K Street. The bird, a typical gray, would stand on the ledge and appear to look across the backyards in the direction of Betsy Ann\u2019s roof, now an empty space because the coop had been dismantled for use as firewood in Miss Jenny\u2019s kitchen stove. When the girl first noticed him and realized who he was, she said nothing, but after a few days, she began to call to him, beseech him to come to her. She came to the very edge of the roof, for now the rope fence was gone and nothing held her back. When the bird would not come to her, she cursed him. After as much as an hour it would fly away and return the next morning.\\n',\n", " '\\n',\n", " 'On what turned out to be the last day, a very cold morning in February, she stepped out onto the roof to drink the last of her cocoa. At first she sipped, then she took one final swallow, and in the time it took her to raise the cup to her lips and lower it, the pigeon had taken a step and dropped from the ledge. He caught an upwind that took him nearly as high as the tops of the empty K Street houses. He flew farther into Northeast, into the colors and sounds of the city\u2019s morning.

I am wearing a checkeredlike blue-and-green cotton dress, and scattered about these colors are bits of yellow and white and brown. My mother has uncharacteristically spent nearly an hour on my hair that morning, plaiting and replaiting so that now my scalp tingles. Whenever I turn my head quickly, my nose fills with the faint smell of Dixie Peach hair grease. The smell is somehow a soothing one now and I will reach for it time and time again before the morning ends. All the plaits, each with a blue barrette near the tip and each twisted into an uncommon sturdiness, will last until I go to bed that night, something that has never happened before. My stomach is full of milk and oatmeal sweetened with brown sugar. Like everything else I have on, my pale green slip and underwear are new, the underwear having come three to a plastic package with a little girl on the front who appears to be dancing. Behind my ears, my mother, to stop my whining, has dabbed the stingiest bit of her gardenia perfume, the last present my father gave her before he disappeared into memory. Because I cannot smell it, I have only her word that the perfume is there. I am also wearing yellow socks trimmed with thin lines of black and white around the tops. My shoes are my greatest joy, black patent-leather miracles, and when one is nicked at the toe later that morning in class, my heart will break.\\n',\n", " '\\n',\n", " 'I am carrying a pencil, a pencil sharpener, and a small ten-cent tablet with a black-and-white speckled cover. My mother does not believe that a girl in kindergarten needs such things, so I am taking them only because of my insistent whining and because they are presents from our neighbors, Mary Keith and Blondelle Harris. Miss Mary and Miss Blondelle are watching my two younger sisters until my mother returns. The women are as precious to me as my mother and sisters. Out playing one day, I have overheard an older child, speaking to another child, call Miss Mary and Miss Blondelle a word that is brand new to me. This is my mother: When I say the word in fun to one of my sisters, my mother slaps me across the mouth and the word is lost for years and years.\\n',\n", " '\\n',\n", " 'All the way down New Jersey Avenue, the sidewalks are teeming with children.

The woman who greets us has pearls thick as jumbo marbles that come down almost to her navel, and she acts as if she had known me all my life, touching my shoulder, cupping her hand under my chin. She is enveloped in a perfume that I only know is not gardenia. When, in answer to her question, my mother tells her that we live at 1227 New Jersey Avenue, the woman first seems to be picturing in her head where we live.

My mother is not convinced and for several more minutes she questions the woman about why I cannot attend Seaton. For as many Sundays as I can remember, perhaps even Sundays when I was in her womb, my mother has pointed across I Street to Seaton as we come and go to Mt. Carmel. \u201cYou gonna go there and learn about the whole world.\u201d But one of the guardians of that place is saying no, and no again.

We find our way to the crowded auditorium where gray metal chairs are set up in the middle of the room. Along the wall to the left are tables and other chairs. Every chair seems occupied by a child or adult. Somewhere in the room a child is crying, a cry that rises above the buzz-talk of so many people.

This is my mother: As the questions go on, she takes from her pocketbook document after document, as if they will support my right to attend school, as if she has been saving them up for just this moment. Indeed, she takes out more papers than I have ever seen her do in other places: my birth certificate, my baptismal record, a doctor\u2019s letter concerning my bout with chicken pox, rent receipts, records of immunization, a letter about our public assistance payments, even her marriage license\u2014every single paper that has anything even remotely to do with my five-year-old life. Few of the papers are needed here, but it does not matter and my mother continues to pull out the documents with the purposefulness of a magician pulling out a long string of scarves.

FAMILY IS THE SECRET TO SINGER\u2019S SUCCESS, the Afro headline said. And in the photograph accompanying that story, Cassandra was sitting on the couch beside Rhonda\u2019s youngest brother, who sat next to Rhonda. Rhonda was in the middle, holding her daughter Alice on her lap. The child was the only person in the picture who did not look directly into the camera. On the other side of Rhonda was her mother, and behind Rhonda were two older brothers and her father, who peered out through thick glasses. Beside Mr. Ferguson and directly behind Rhonda was Jeffrey Stanford, the father of Rhonda\u2019s child.

Some of them danced.\\n',\n", " '\\n',\n", " '\\n',\n", " '\\n',\n", " 'Cassandra decided right then to make nice and return her brother-in-law\u2019s car. But after she started it up, the car would only cough and shake and didn\u2019t seem to want to move. After trying several times to get it going, she thought she\u2019d give it time to make up its mind about going. She passed the time listening to radio music that came out mostly static because she had deliberately damaged the radio five months ago after an argument with her brother-in-law. Toward three thirty, as she was counting her cigarettes, Melanie Cartwright, on her way home, tapped on the roof.

Gladys explained that her mother wanted a few small boxes of stuff taken to Gladys\u2019s father in Anacostia. Cassandra didn\u2019t know Gladys at all, except to see her now and again passing in the school\u2019s halls. Taking boxes from the mother to the father all the way in Anacostia seemed strange to Cassandra, but being an orphan set adrift in the world she had learned that unless it could involve a death mistake, it was best to ask as few questions as possible. And besides, twenty bucks was twenty bucks. Anita and Melanie said they wouldn\u2019t mind coming along: Melanie\u2019s boyfriend had football practice, and Friday evenings Anita\u2019s parents allowed her a bit more leeway than they did on school nights.\\n',\n", " '\\n',\n", " '\u201cWill this thing hold up down there and back?\u201d Gladys said of the Hudson, looking at it from front to back and up and down. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get stuck out there with my gotdamn father and his bitch whore.\u201d\\n',\n", " '\\n',\n", " '\u201cIt\u2019ll do what I tell it,\u201d Cassandra said, thinking she might get to see a fight. She and Gladys waited while Anita and Melanie took their books home, a short distance away. When they returned, Cassandra started up the car without any trouble and the four drove down Clifton Street to Gladys\u2019s house on 12th Street. The house and the yard were uncommonly immaculate. Such houses made Cassandra nervous, because she associated them with owners who, without warning, smacked the hands of visiting children reaching out with curiosity to touch something.\\n',\n", " '\\n',\n", " 'Mildred Harper set the four girls at her kitchen table and fed them a dinner of reheated fried chicken, string beans, potato salad, and rolls. \u201cMy husband and I,\u201d she said to Cassandra as she set out the food, \u201care separated.

He\u2019s not well enough to come get them.\u201d They sounded like words she had already said a thousand times, had learned to say to get it all out and over with. Anita and Melanie must have heard it before, because they didn\u2019t seem surprised at what the mother was saying.

The birds, somewhere among those leaves and among the nooks and crannies of buildings, were making a racket as they bedded down. Cassandra felt good, because her stomach was full and she had a little piece of change in her pocket and she had a bed waiting that night at Rhonda\u2019s. At Elson\u2019s at 11th and T she filled up the gas tank. They continued on down 11th Street. As usual when she drove, Cassandra leaned forward, her arms folded over the top of the steering wheel, the cigarette in her mouth bouncing up and down whenever she said anything.

He would stand beside her on most Fridays over those months as she took forever to fill out the deposit slip, making first one mistake, then another, then dropping the crossed-out slips into the wastebasket beside the table.

She was overweight, and he saw that walking was not easy for her in the heat. For the first time since he had been following her, she was not wearing her uniform. She had on a blue skirt and a pink blouse, which she wore outside the skirt. She had on tiny, gold-plated earrings a person might not notice until he was within a foot or so of her, and that was how close he was when he walked past her.

What fascinated Caesar most about the apartment was the dominance of sound, of noise, as if Sherman were afraid of silence. In every room, there was something playing each second of the day, whether a radio or television or cassette player. In the bathroom, hanging from the shower curtain rod, there was a transistor radio that played around the clock. Sherman lived alone in the apartment, but he had two children by Sandra, who lived elsewhere in the building with the children. Most of the time when Caesar and Angelo visited, they would find Sherman wrapped in his bathrobe sitting on the couch, listening to one of dozens of cassette tapes that Sandra had recorded of the children talking and playing with each other. There were four speakers in the living room that stood three feet high, and he enjoyed playing those cassettes so loud that the noise of the children made it sound like a playground with a hundred children. Now and again, one child would hit the other or say something mean and there would be a fit of crying on the tape. Sherman would jump up and speed the tape past the crying to a place where the talking and playing resumed.\\n',\n", " '\\n',\n", " 'The apartment, despite the noise, became another home for Caesar and he began going there without Angelo after school.
