It was\n", "of a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here and there stuck over with\n", "large blackish looking squares. Yes, it\u2019s just as I thought, he\u2019s a\n", "terrible bedfellow; he\u2019s been in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here\n", "he is, just from the surgeon.

I remembered a story\n", "of a white man\u2014a whaleman too\u2014who, falling among the cannibals, had\n", "been tattooed by them. I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course\n", "of his distant voyages, must have met with a similar adventure. And\n", "what is it, thought I, after all! It\u2019s only his outside; a man can be\n", "honest in any sort of skin. But then, what to make of his unearthly\n", "complexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about, and completely\n", "independent of the squares of tattooing. To be sure, it might be\n", "nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never heard of a hot\n", "sun\u2019s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one. However, I had\n", "never been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun there produced these\n", "extraordinary effects upon the skin. Now, while all these ideas were\n", "passing through me like lightning, this harpooneer never noticed me at\n", "all. But, after some difficulty having opened his bag, he commenced\n", "fumbling in it, and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a\n", "seal-skin wallet with the hair on. Placing these on the old chest in\n", "the middle of the room, he then took the New Zealand head\u2014a ghastly\n", "thing enough\u2014and crammed it down into the bag. He now took off his\n", "hat\u2014a new beaver hat\u2014when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise.\n", "There was no hair on his head\u2014none to speak of at least\u2014nothing but a\n", "small scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead.

Still\n", "more, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs\n", "were running up the trunks of young palms. It was now quite plain that\n", "he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman\n", "in the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian country. I quaked to\n", "think of it. A peddler of heads too\u2014perhaps the heads of his own\n", "brothers. He might take a fancy to mine\u2014heavens! look at that tomahawk!\n", "\n", "But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about\n", "something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me\n", "that he must indeed be a heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall,\n", "or dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in\n", "the pockets, and produced at length a curious little deformed image\n", "with a hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a three days\u2019 old\n", "Congo baby. Remembering the embalmed head, at first I almost thought\n", "that this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar\n", "manner. But seeing that it was not at all limber, and that it glistened\n", "a good deal like polished ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing\n", "but a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to be. For now the savage\n", "goes up to the empty fire-place, and removing the papered fire-board,\n", "sets up this little hunch-backed image, like a tenpin, between the\n", "andirons. The chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty,\n", "so that I thought this fire-place made a very appropriate little shrine\n", "or chapel for his Congo idol.\n", "\n", "I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but\n", "ill at ease meantime\u2014to see what was next to follow. First he takes\n", "about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places\n", "them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on\n", "top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the shavings into\n", "a sacrificial blaze. Presently, after many hasty snatches into the\n", "fire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed\n", "to be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the\n", "biscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite\n", "offer of it to the little negro. But the little devil did not seem to\n", "fancy such dry sort of fare at all; he never moved his lips. All these\n", "strange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from\n", "the devotee, who seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else singing\n", "some pagan psalmody or other, during which his face twitched about in\n", "the most unnatural manner. At last extinguishing the fire, he took the\n", "idol up very unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket\n", "as carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.\n", "\n", "All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and seeing\n", "him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business\n", "operations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time,\n", "now or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell in which\n", "I had so long been bound.\n", "\n", "But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal one.\n", "Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of it for\n", "an instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth at the\n", "handle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke. The next moment\n", "the light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between\n", "his teeth, sprang into bed with me. I sang out, I could not help it\n", "now; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me.\n", "\n", "Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him\n", "against the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might\n", "be, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again.

He really did this in not only a\n", "civil but a really kind and charitable way. I stood looking at him a\n", "moment. For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely\n", "looking cannibal. What\u2019s all this fuss I have been making about,\n", "thought I to myself\u2014the man\u2019s a human being just as I am: he has just\n", "as much reason to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him. Better sleep\n", "with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.\n", "\n", "\u201cLandlord,\u201d said I, \u201ctell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe, or\n", "whatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I will\n", "turn in with him.

The Counterpane.\n", "\n", "Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg\u2019s arm thrown\n", "over me in the most loving and affectionate manner. You had almost\n", "thought I had been his wife. The counterpane was of patchwork, full of\n", "odd little parti-coloured squares and triangles; and this arm of his\n", "tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure, no\n", "two parts of which were of one precise shade\u2014owing I suppose to his\n", "keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade, his shirt\n", "sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times\u2014this same arm of his, I\n", "say, looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork\n", "quilt. Indeed, partly lying on it as the arm did when I first awoke, I\n", "could hardly tell it from the quilt, they so blended their hues\n", "together; and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that I\n", "could tell that Queequeg was hugging me.\n", "\n", "My sensations were strange. Let me try to explain them. When I was a\n", "child, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me;\n", "whether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely settle. The\n", "circumstance was this. I had been cutting up some caper or other\u2014I\n", "think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had seen a little\n", "sweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who, somehow or other,\n", "was all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed supperless,\u2014my\n", "mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to\n", "bed, though it was only two o\u2019clock in the afternoon of the 21st June,\n", "the longest day in the year in our hemisphere. I felt dreadfully. But\n", "there was no help for it, so up stairs I went to my little room in the\n", "third floor, undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time,\n", "and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets.\n", "\n", "I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse\n", "before I could hope for a resurrection. Sixteen hours in bed! the small\n", "of my back ached to think of it. And it was so light too; the sun\n", "shining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in the\n", "streets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house. I felt worse\n", "and worse\u2014at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in my\n", "stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw myself at\n", "her feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good\n", "slippering for my misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning me to\n", "lie abed such an unendurable length of time. But she was the best and\n", "most conscientious of stepmothers, and back I had to go to my room. For\n", "several hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a great deal worse than\n", "I have ever done since, even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes.\n", "At last I must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze; and\n", "slowly waking from it\u2014half steeped in dreams\u2014I opened my eyes, and the\n", "before sun-lit room was now wrapped in outer darkness. Instantly I felt\n", "a shock running through all my frame; nothing was to be seen, and\n", "nothing was to be heard; but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine.\n", "My arm hung over the counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable,\n", "silent form or phantom, to which the hand belonged, seemed closely\n", "seated by my bed-side. For what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there,\n", "frozen with the most awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet\n", "ever thinking that if I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid\n", "spell would be broken. I knew not how this consciousness at last glided\n", "away from me; but waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered it\n", "all, and for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in\n", "confounding attempts to explain the mystery. Nay, to this very hour, I\n", "often puzzle myself with it.\n", "\n", "Now, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the\n", "supernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness, to\n", "those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg\u2019s pagan arm\n", "thrown round me. But at length all the past night\u2019s events soberly\n", "recurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only alive to\n", "the comical predicament. For though I tried to move his arm\u2014unlock his\n", "bridegroom clasp\u2014yet, sleeping as he was, he still hugged me tightly,\n", "as though naught but death should part us twain. I now strove to rouse\n", "him\u2014\u201cQueequeg!\u201d\u2014but his only answer was a snore. I then rolled over, my\n", "neck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar; and suddenly felt a\n", "slight scratch. Throwing aside the counterpane, there lay the tomahawk\n", "sleeping by the savage\u2019s side, as if it were a hatchet-faced baby. A\n", "pretty pickle, truly, thought I; abed here in a strange house in the\n", "broad day, with a cannibal and a tomahawk! \u201cQueequeg!\u2014in the name of\n", "goodness, Queequeg, wake!\u201d At length, by dint of much wriggling, and\n", "loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his\n", "hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in\n", "extracting a grunt; and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself\n", "all over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in\n", "bed, stiff as a pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if\n", "he did not altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim\n", "consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over\n", "him. Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious misgivings\n", "now, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature. When, at\n", "last, his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow,\n", "and he became, as it were, reconciled to the fact; he jumped out upon\n", "the floor, and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that,\n", "if it pleased me, he would dress first and then leave me to dress\n", "afterwards, leaving the whole apartment to myself. Thinks I, Queequeg,\n", "under the circumstances, this is a very civilized overture; but, the\n", "truth is, these savages have an innate sense of delicacy, say what you\n", "will; it is marvellous how essentially polite they are. I pay this\n", "particular compliment to Queequeg, because he treated me with so much\n", "civility and consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness;\n", "staring at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions; for\n", "the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding. Nevertheless,\n", "a man like Queequeg you don\u2019t see every day, he and his ways were well\n", "worth unusual regarding.\n", "\n", "He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall\n", "one, by the by, and then\u2014still minus his trowsers\u2014he hunted up his\n", "boots. What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his\n", "next movement was to crush himself\u2014boots in hand, and hat on\u2014under the\n", "bed; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I inferred he\n", "was hard at work booting himself; though by no law of propriety that I\n", "ever heard of, is any man required to be private when putting on his\n", "boots. But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature in the transition\n", "stage\u2014neither caterpillar nor butterfly. He was just enough civilized\n", "to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners. His\n", "education was not yet completed. He was an undergraduate. If he had not\n", "been a small degree civilized, he very probably would not have troubled\n", "himself with boots at all; but then, if he had not been still a savage,\n", "he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on. At\n", "last, he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over\n", "his eyes, and began creaking and limping about the room, as if, not\n", "being much accustomed to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide\n", "ones\u2014probably not made to order either\u2014rather pinched and tormented him\n", "at the first go off of a bitter cold morning.\n", "\n", "Seeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the\n", "street being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view\n", "into the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that\n", "Queequeg made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots on;\n", "I begged him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet somewhat, and\n", "particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible. He\n", "complied, and then proceeded to wash himself. At that time in the\n", "morning any Christian would have washed his face; but Queequeg, to my\n", "amazement, contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his\n", "chest, arms, and hands. He then donned his waistcoat, and taking up a\n", "piece of hard soap on the wash-stand centre table, dipped it into water\n", "and commenced lathering his face. I was watching to see where he kept\n", "his razor, when lo and behold, he takes the harpoon from the bed\n", "corner, slips out the long wooden stock, unsheathes the head, whets it\n", "a little on his boot, and striding up to the bit of mirror against the\n", "wall, begins a vigorous scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks.\n", "Thinks I, Queequeg, this is using Rogers\u2019s best cutlery with a\n", "vengeance. Afterwards I wondered the less at this operation when I came\n", "to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how\n", "exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept.\n", "\n", "The rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out of\n", "the room, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket, and sporting his\n", "harpoon like a marshal\u2019s baton.\n", "\n", "\n", "CHAPTER 5. Breakfast.\n", "\n", "I quickly followed suit, and descending into the bar-room accosted the\n", "grinning landlord very pleasantly. I cherished no malice towards him,\n", "though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my\n", "bedfellow.\n", "\n", "However, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and rather too scarce a\n", "good thing; the more\u2019s the pity. So, if any one man, in his own proper\n", "person, afford stuff for a good joke to anybody, let him not be\n", "backward, but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in\n", "that way. And the man that has anything bountifully laughable about\n", "him, be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for.\n", "\n", "The bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the\n", "night previous, and whom I had not as yet had a good look at. They were\n", "nearly all whalemen; chief mates, and second mates, and third mates,\n", "and sea carpenters, and sea coopers, and sea blacksmiths, and\n", "harpooneers, and ship keepers; a brown and brawny company, with bosky\n", "beards; an unshorn, shaggy set, all wearing monkey jackets for morning\n", "gowns.\n", "\n", "You could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore. This\n", "young fellow\u2019s healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue, and\n", "would seem to smell almost as musky; he cannot have been three days\n", "landed from his Indian voyage. That man next him looks a few shades\n", "lighter; you might say a touch of satin wood is in him. In the\n", "complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn, but slightly\n", "bleached withal; _he_ doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore. But who\n", "could show a cheek like Queequeg? which, barred with various tints,\n", "seemed like the Andes\u2019 western slope, to show forth in one array,\n", "contrasting climates, zone by zone.\n", "\n", "\u201cGrub, ho!\u201d now cried the landlord, flinging open a door, and in we\n", "went to breakfast.\n", "\n", "They say that men who have seen the world, thereby become quite at ease\n", "in manner, quite self-possessed in company. Not always, though:\n", "Ledyard, the great New England traveller, and Mungo Park, the Scotch\n", "one; of all men, they possessed the least assurance in the parlor. But\n", "perhaps the mere crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as\n", "Ledyard did, or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach, in\n", "the negro heart of Africa, which was the sum of poor Mungo\u2019s\n", "performances\u2014this kind of travel, I say, may not be the very best mode\n", "of attaining a high social polish. Still, for the most part, that sort\n", "of thing is to be had anywhere.\n", "\n", "These reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that\n", "after we were all seated at the table, and I was preparing to hear some\n", "good stories about whaling; to my no small surprise, nearly every man\n", "maintained a profound silence. And not only that, but they looked\n", "embarrassed. Yes, here were a set of sea-dogs, many of whom without the\n", "slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seas\u2014entire\n", "strangers to them\u2014and duelled them dead without winking; and yet, here\n", "they sat at a social breakfast table\u2014all of the same calling, all of\n", "kindred tastes\u2014looking round as sheepishly at each other as though they\n", "had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the Green\n", "Mountains. A curious sight; these bashful bears, these timid warrior\n", "whalemen!\n", "\n", "But as for Queequeg\u2014why, Queequeg sat there among them\u2014at the head of\n", "the table, too, it so chanced; as cool as an icicle. To be sure I\n", "cannot say much for his breeding. His greatest admirer could not have\n", "cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him,\n", "and using it there without ceremony; reaching over the table with it,\n", "to the imminent jeopardy of many heads, and grappling the beefsteaks\n", "towards him. But _that_ was certainly very coolly done by him, and\n", "every one knows that in most people\u2019s estimation, to do anything coolly\n", "is to do it genteelly.\n", "\n", "We will not speak of all Queequeg\u2019s peculiarities here; how he eschewed\n", "coffee and hot rolls, and applied his undivided attention to\n", "beefsteaks, done rare. Enough, that when breakfast was over he withdrew\n", "like the rest into the public room, lighted his tomahawk-pipe, and was\n", "sitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat\n", "on, when I sallied out for a stroll.\n", "\n", "\n", "CHAPTER 6. The Street.\n", "\n", "If I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish\n", "an individual as Queequeg circulating among the polite society of a\n", "civilized town, that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first\n", "daylight stroll through the streets of New Bedford.\n", "\n", "In thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable seaport will\n", "frequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign\n", "parts. Even in Broadway and Chestnut streets, Mediterranean mariners\n", "will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies.

In these last-mentioned haunts you see only\n", "sailors; but in New Bedford, actual cannibals stand chatting at street\n", "corners; savages outright; many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy\n", "flesh.

There weekly arrive in this town\n", "scores of green Vermonters and New Hampshire men, all athirst for gain\n", "and glory in the fishery. They are mostly young, of stalwart frames;\n", "fellows who have felled forests, and now seek to drop the axe and\n", "snatch the whale-lance. Many are as green as the Green Mountains whence\n", "they came. In some things you would think them but a few hours old.\n", "Look there! that chap strutting round the corner. He wears a beaver hat\n", "and swallow-tailed coat, girdled with a sailor-belt and sheath-knife.\n", "Here comes another with a sou\u2019-wester and a bombazine cloak.\n", "\n", "No town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred one\u2014I mean a\n", "downright bumpkin dandy\u2014a fellow that, in the dog-days, will mow his\n", "two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands. Now when a\n", "country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished\n", "reputation, and joins the great whale-fishery, you should see the\n", "comical things he does upon reaching the seaport. In bespeaking his\n", "sea-outfit, he orders bell-buttons to his waistcoats; straps to his\n", "canvas trowsers.

As it is, parts of her back country are enough to frighten\n", "one, they look so bony. The town itself is perhaps the dearest place to\n", "live in, in all New England. It is a land of oil, true enough: but not\n", "like Canaan; a land, also, of corn and wine.

Through all his unearthly tattooings, I thought I\n", "saw the traces of a simple honest heart; and in his large, deep eyes,\n", "fiery black and bold, there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a\n", "thousand devils. And besides all this, there was a certain lofty\n", "bearing about the Pagan, which even his uncouthness could not\n", "altogether maim. He looked like a man who had never cringed and never\n", "had had a creditor. Whether it was, too, that his head being shaved,\n", "his forehead was drawn out in freer and brighter relief, and looked\n", "more expansive than it otherwise would, this I will not venture to\n", "decide; but certain it was his head was phrenologically an excellent\n", "one. It may seem ridiculous, but it reminded me of General Washington\u2019s\n", "head, as seen in the popular busts of him. It had the same long\n", "regularly graded retreating slope from above the brows, which were\n", "likewise very projecting, like two long promontories thickly wooded on\n", "top. Queequeg was George Washington cannibalistically developed.\n", "\n", "Whilst I was thus closely scanning him, half-pretending meanwhile to be\n", "looking out at the storm from the casement, he never heeded my\n", "presence, never troubled himself with so much as a single glance; but\n", "appeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous\n", "book. Considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night\n", "previous, and especially considering the affectionate arm I had found\n", "thrown over me upon waking in the morning, I thought this indifference\n", "of his very strange. But savages are strange beings; at times you do\n", "not know exactly how to take them. At first they are overawing; their\n", "calm self-collectedness of simplicity seems a Socratic wisdom.

Surely this was a touch of fine philosophy;\n", "though no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that.

I felt a melting in me. No more my splintered heart\n", "and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world. This soothing\n", "savage had redeemed it. There he sat, his very indifference speaking a\n", "nature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland\n", "deceits.

I\u2019ll try a pagan friend, thought I, since Christian kindness\n", "has proved but hollow courtesy.

At\n", "first he little noticed these advances; but presently, upon my\n", "referring to his last night\u2019s hospitalities, he made out to ask me\n", "whether we were again to be bedfellows.

Thus I soon engaged his interest; and from that we\n", "went to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to\n", "be seen in this famous town. Soon I proposed a social smoke; and,\n", "producing his pouch and tomahawk, he quietly offered me a puff. And\n", "then we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his, and keeping it\n", "regularly passing between us.\n", "\n", "If there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the Pagan\u2019s\n", "breast, this pleasant, genial smoke we had, soon thawed it out, and\n", "left us cronies.

In a\n", "countryman, this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too\n", "premature, a thing to be much distrusted; but in this simple savage\n", "those old rules would not apply.\n", "\n", "After supper, and another social chat and smoke, we went to our room\n", "together. He made me a present of his embalmed head; took out his\n", "enormous tobacco wallet, and groping under the tobacco, drew out some\n", "thirty dollars in silver; then spreading them on the table, and\n", "mechanically dividing them into two equal portions, pushed one of them\n", "towards me, and said it was mine. I was going to remonstrate; but he\n", "silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers\u2019 pockets. I let them stay.\n", "He then went about his evening prayers, took out his idol, and removed\n", "the paper fireboard. By certain signs and symptoms, I thought he seemed\n", "anxious for me to join him; but well knowing what was to follow, I\n", "deliberated a moment whether, in case he invited me, I would comply or\n", "otherwise.\n", "\n", "I was a good Christian; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible\n", "Presbyterian Church. How then could I unite with this wild idolator in\n", "worshipping his piece of wood? But what is worship? thought I. Do you\n", "suppose now, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of heaven and\n", "earth\u2014pagans and all included\u2014can possibly be jealous of an\n", "insignificant bit of black wood? Impossible! But what is worship?\u2014to do\n", "the will of God\u2014_that_ is worship. And what is the will of God?\u2014to do\n", "to my fellow man what I would have my fellow man to do to me\u2014_that_ is\n", "the will of God. Now, Queequeg is my fellow man. And what do I wish\n", "that this Queequeg would do to me? Why, unite with me in my particular\n", "Presbyterian form of worship. Consequently, I must then unite with him\n", "in his; ergo, I must turn idolator. So I kindled the shavings; helped\n", "prop up the innocent little idol; offered him burnt biscuit with\n", "Queequeg; salamed before him twice or thrice; kissed his nose; and that\n", "done, we undressed and went to bed, at peace with our own consciences\n", "and all the world.

Nightgown.\n", "\n", "We had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short intervals, and\n", "Queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs\n", "over mine, and then drawing them back; so entirely sociable and free\n", "and easy were we; when, at last, by reason of our confabulations, what\n", "little nappishness remained in us altogether departed, and we felt like\n", "getting up again, though day-break was yet some way down the future.\n", "\n", "Yes, we became very wakeful; so much so that our recumbent position\n", "began to grow wearisome, and by little and little we found ourselves\n", "sitting up; the clothes well tucked around us, leaning against the\n", "head-board with our four knees drawn up close together, and our two\n", "noses bending over them, as if our kneepans were warming-pans. We felt\n", "very nice and snug, the more so since it was so chilly out of doors;\n", "indeed out of bed-clothes too, seeing that there was no fire in the\n", "room. The more so, I say, because truly to enjoy bodily warmth, some\n", "small part of you must be cold, for there is no quality in this world\n", "that is not what it is merely by contrast. Nothing exists in itself. If\n", "you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable, and have been\n", "so a long time, then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more. But\n", "if, like Queequeg and me in the bed, the tip of your nose or the crown\n", "of your head be slightly chilled, why then, indeed, in the general\n", "consciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm. For\n", "this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire,\n", "which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich. For the height\n", "of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket\n", "between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air. Then there\n", "you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal.\n", "\n", "We had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time, when all at\n", "once I thought I would open my eyes; for when between sheets, whether\n", "by day or by night, and whether asleep or awake, I have a way of always\n", "keeping my eyes shut, in order the more to concentrate the snugness of\n", "being in bed. Because no man can ever feel his own identity aright\n", "except his eyes be closed; as if darkness were indeed the proper\n", "element of our essences, though light be more congenial to our clayey\n", "part. Upon opening my eyes then, and coming out of my own pleasant and\n", "self-created darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the\n", "unilluminated twelve-o\u2019clock-at-night, I experienced a disagreeable\n", "revulsion. Nor did I at all object to the hint from Queequeg that\n", "perhaps it were best to strike a light, seeing that we were so wide\n", "awake; and besides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs\n", "from his Tomahawk. Be it said, that though I had felt such a strong\n", "repugnance to his smoking in the bed the night before, yet see how\n", "elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them.\n", "For now I liked nothing better than to have Queequeg smoking by me,\n", "even in bed, because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy\n", "then. I no more felt unduly concerned for the landlord\u2019s policy of\n", "insurance. I was only alive to the condensed confidential\n", "comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend.\n", "With our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders, we now passed the\n", "Tomahawk from one to the other, till slowly there grew over us a blue\n", "hanging tester of smoke, illuminated by the flame of the new-lit lamp.\n", "\n", "Whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to\n", "far distant scenes, I know not, but he now spoke of his native island;\n", "and, eager to hear his history, I begged him to go on and tell it. He\n", "gladly complied. Though at the time I but ill comprehended not a few of\n", "his words, yet subsequent disclosures, when I had become more familiar\n", "with his broken phraseology, now enable me to present the whole story\n", "such as it may prove in the mere skeleton I give.\n", "\n", "\n", "CHAPTER 12. Biographical.\n", "\n", "Queequeg was a native of Rokovoko, an island far away to the West and\n", "South. It is not down in any map; true places never are.\n", "\n", "When a new-hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in a\n", "grass clout, followed by the nibbling goats, as if he were a green\n", "sapling; even then, in Queequeg\u2019s ambitious soul, lurked a strong\n", "desire to see something more of Christendom than a specimen whaler or\n", "two. His father was a High Chief, a King; his uncle a High Priest; and\n", "on the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of\n", "unconquerable warriors. There was excellent blood in his veins\u2014royal\n", "stuff; though sadly vitiated, I fear, by the cannibal propensity he\n", "nourished in his untutored youth.\n", "\n", "A Sag Harbor ship visited his father\u2019s bay, and Queequeg sought a\n", "passage to Christian lands. But the ship, having her full complement of\n", "seamen, spurned his suit; and not all the King his father\u2019s influence\n", "could prevail. But Queequeg vowed a vow. Alone in his canoe, he paddled\n", "off to a distant strait, which he knew the ship must pass through when\n", "she quitted the island. On one side was a coral reef; on the other a\n", "low tongue of land, covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into\n", "the water. Hiding his canoe, still afloat, among these thickets, with\n", "its prow seaward, he sat down in the stern, paddle low in hand; and\n", "when the ship was gliding by, like a flash he darted out; gained her\n", "side; with one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe;\n", "climbed up the chains; and throwing himself at full length upon the\n", "deck, grappled a ring-bolt there, and swore not to let it go, though\n", "hacked in pieces.\n", "\n", "In vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard; suspended a\n", "cutlass over his naked wrists; Queequeg was the son of a King, and\n", "Queequeg budged not. Struck by his desperate dauntlessness, and his\n", "wild desire to visit Christendom, the captain at last relented, and\n", "told him he might make himself at home. But this fine young savage\u2014this\n", "sea Prince of Wales, never saw the Captain\u2019s cabin. They put him down\n", "among the sailors, and made a whaleman of him. But like Czar Peter\n", "content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities, Queequeg disdained\n", "no seeming ignominy, if thereby he might happily gain the power of\n", "enlightening his untutored countrymen. For at bottom\u2014so he told me\u2014he\n", "was actuated by a profound desire to learn among the Christians, the\n", "arts whereby to make his people still happier than they were; and more\n", "than that, still better than they were. But, alas! the practices of\n", "whalemen soon convinced him that even Christians could be both\n", "miserable and wicked; infinitely more so, than all his father\u2019s\n", "heathens. Arrived at last in old Sag Harbor; and seeing what the\n", "sailors did there; and then going on to Nantucket, and seeing how they\n", "spent their wages in _that_ place also, poor Queequeg gave it up for\n", "lost. Thought he, it\u2019s a wicked world in all meridians; I\u2019ll die a\n", "pagan.\n", "\n", "And thus an old idolator at heart, he yet lived among these Christians,\n", "wore their clothes, and tried to talk their gibberish. Hence the queer\n", "ways about him, though now some time from home.\n", "\n", "By hints, I asked him whether he did not propose going back, and having\n", "a coronation; since he might now consider his father dead and gone, he\n", "being very old and feeble at the last accounts. He answered no, not\n", "yet; and added that he was fearful Christianity, or rather Christians,\n", "had unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty\n", "pagan Kings before him. But by and by, he said, he would return,\u2014as\n", "soon as he felt himself baptized again. For the nonce, however, he\n", "proposed to sail about, and sow his wild oats in all four oceans. They\n", "had made a harpooneer of him, and that barbed iron was in lieu of a\n", "sceptre now.\n", "\n", "I asked him what might be his immediate purpose, touching his future\n", "movements. He answered, to go to sea again, in his old vocation. Upon\n", "this, I told him that whaling was my own design, and informed him of my\n", "intention to sail out of Nantucket, as being the most promising port\n", "for an adventurous whaleman to embark from. He at once resolved to\n", "accompany me to that island, ship aboard the same vessel, get into the\n", "same watch, the same boat, the same mess with me, in short to share my\n", "every hap; with both my hands in his, boldly dip into the Potluck of\n", "both worlds. To all this I joyously assented; for besides the affection\n", "I now felt for Queequeg, he was an experienced harpooneer, and as such,\n", "could not fail to be of great usefulness to one, who, like me, was\n", "wholly ignorant of the mysteries of whaling, though well acquainted\n", "with the sea, as known to merchant seamen.\n", "\n", "His story being ended with his pipe\u2019s last dying puff, Queequeg\n", "embraced me, pressed his forehead against mine, and blowing out the\n", "light, we rolled over from each other, this way and that, and very soon\n", "were sleeping.\n", "\n", "\n", "CHAPTER 13. Wheelbarrow.\n", "\n", "Next morning, Monday, after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber,\n", "for a block, I settled my own and comrade\u2019s bill; using, however, my\n", "comrade\u2019s money.

As we were going along the people stared; not at Queequeg so\n", "much\u2014for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their\n", "streets,\u2014but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms. But we\n", "heeded them not, going along wheeling the barrow by turns, and Queequeg\n", "now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs. I\n", "asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore, and\n", "whether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons. To this, in\n", "substance, he replied, that though what I hinted was true enough, yet\n", "he had a particular affection for his own harpoon, because it was of\n", "assured stuff, well tried in many a mortal combat, and deeply intimate\n", "with the hearts of whales. In short, like many inland reapers and\n", "mowers, who go into the farmers\u2019 meadows armed with their own\n", "scythes\u2014though in no wise obliged to furnish them\u2014even so, Queequeg,\n", "for his own private reasons, preferred his own harpoon.\n", "\n", "Shifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny story about\n", "the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen. It was in Sag Harbor. The\n", "owners of his ship, it seems, had lent him one, in which to carry his\n", "heavy chest to his boarding house. Not to seem ignorant about the\n", "thing\u2014though in truth he was entirely so, concerning the precise way in\n", "which to manage the barrow\u2014Queequeg puts his chest upon it; lashes it\n", "fast; and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf. \u201cWhy,\u201d\n", "said I, \u201cQueequeg, you might have known better than that, one would\n", "think.

Upon each side of\n", "the Pequod\u2019s quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds,\n", "there was an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the\n", "plank. His bone leg steadied in that hole; one arm elevated, and\n", "holding by a shroud; Captain Ahab stood erect, looking straight out\n", "beyond the ship\u2019s ever-pitching prow.

Not a word he spoke; nor\n", "did his officers say aught to him; though by all their minutest\n", "gestures and expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if not\n", "painful, consciousness of being under a troubled master-eye. And not\n", "only that, but moody stricken Ahab stood before them with a crucifixion\n", "in his face; in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some\n", "mighty woe.\n", "\n", "Ere long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his cabin.\n", "But after that morning, he was every day visible to the crew; either\n", "standing in his pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he had; or\n", "heavily walking the deck. As the sky grew less gloomy; indeed, began to\n", "grow a little genial, he became still less and less a recluse; as if,\n", "when the ship had sailed from home, nothing but the dead wintry\n", "bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded. And, by and by, it\n", "came to pass, that he was almost continually in the air; but, as yet,\n", "for all that he said, or perceptibly did, on the at last sunny deck, he\n", "seemed as unnecessary there as another mast. But the Pequod was only\n", "making a passage now; not regularly cruising; nearly all whaling\n", "preparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to, so\n", "that there was little or nothing, out of himself, to employ or excite\n", "Ahab, now; and thus chase away, for that one interval, the clouds that\n", "layer upon layer were piled upon his brow, as ever all clouds choose\n", "the loftiest peaks to pile themselves upon.\n", "\n", "Nevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the\n", "pleasant, holiday weather we came to, seemed gradually to charm him\n", "from his mood.

In the length he attains, and\n", "in his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the right whale, but is of a less\n", "portly girth, and a lighter colour, approaching to olive. His great\n", "lips present a cable-like aspect, formed by the intertwisting, slanting\n", "folds of large wrinkles. His grand distinguishing feature, the fin,\n", "from which he derives his name, is often a conspicuous object. This fin\n", "is some three or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder\n", "part of the back, of an angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed\n", "end. Even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible,\n", "this isolated fin will, at times, be seen plainly projecting from the\n", "surface. When the sea is moderately calm, and slightly marked with\n", "spherical ripples, and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows\n", "upon the wrinkled surface, it may well be supposed that the watery\n", "circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial, with its style and\n", "wavy hour-lines graved on it.

In\n", "general, the same remark, only within a less wide limit, applies to the\n", "solitaries and hermits among the matured, aged sperm whales. So that\n", "though Moby Dick had in a former year been seen, for example, on what\n", "is called the Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean, or Volcano Bay on\n", "the Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow, that were the Pequod to\n", "visit either of those spots at any subsequent corresponding season, she\n", "would infallibly encounter him there.

Because, an interval of three hundred and\n", "sixty-five days and nights was before him; an interval which, instead\n", "of impatiently enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt;\n", "if by chance the White Whale, spending his vacation in seas far remote\n", "from his periodical feeding-grounds, should turn up his wrinkled brow\n", "off the Persian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or China Seas, or in any\n", "other waters haunted by his race.

Yes. For the peculiar\n", "snow-white brow of Moby Dick, and his snow-white hump, could not but be\n", "unmistakable.

He sleeps with clenched hands; and wakes\n", "with his own bloody nails in his palms.\n", "\n", "Often, when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid\n", "dreams of the night, which, resuming his own intense thoughts through\n", "the day, carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies, and whirled them\n", "round and round and round in his blazing brain, till the very throbbing\n", "of his life-spot became insufferable anguish; and when, as was\n", "sometimes the case, these spiritual throes in him heaved his being up\n", "from its base, and a chasm seemed opening in him, from which forked\n", "flames and lightnings shot up, and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap\n", "down among them; when this hell in himself yawned beneath him, a wild\n", "cry would be heard through the ship; and with glaring eyes Ahab would\n", "burst from his state room, as though escaping from a bed that was on\n", "fire. Yet these, perhaps, instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms\n", "of some latent weakness, or fright at his own resolve, were but the\n", "plainest tokens of its intensity. For, at such times, crazy Ahab, the\n", "scheming, unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale; this Ahab\n", "that had gone to his hammock, was not the agent that so caused him to\n", "burst from it in horror again. The latter was the eternal, living\n", "principle or soul in him; and in sleep, being for the time dissociated\n", "from the characterizing mind, which at other times employed it for its\n", "outer vehicle or agent, it spontaneously sought escape from the\n", "scorching contiguity of the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it\n", "was no longer an integral. But as the mind does not exist unless\n", "leagued with the soul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab\u2019s\n", "case, yielding up all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme\n", "purpose; that purpose, by its own sheer inveteracy of will, forced\n", "itself against gods and devils into a kind of self-assumed, independent\n", "being of its own. Nay, could grimly live and burn, while the common\n", "vitality to which it was conjoined, fled horror-stricken from the\n", "unbidden and unfathered birth.

The action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and\n", "true. The half-emptied line-tub floats on the whitened sea; the wooden\n", "poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it; the heads of the\n", "swimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions\n", "of affright; while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing\n", "down upon the scene. Serious fault might be found with the anatomical\n", "details of this whale, but let that pass; since, for the life of me, I\n", "could not draw so good a one.\n", "\n", "In the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside\n", "the barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale, that rolls his\n", "black weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the\n", "Patagonian cliffs. His jets are erect, full, and black like soot; so\n", "that from so abounding a smoke in the chimney, you would think there\n", "must be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below.

And now suspended in stages over the\n", "side, Starbuck and Stubb, the mates, armed with their long spades,\n", "began cutting a hole in the body for the insertion of the hook just\n", "above the nearest of the two side-fins. This done, a broad,\n", "semicircular line is cut round the hole, the hook is inserted, and the\n", "main body of the crew striking up a wild chorus, now commence heaving\n", "in one dense crowd at the windlass.

Now as\n", "the blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orange,\n", "so is it stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is sometimes\n", "stripped by spiralizing it.

Into\n", "this hole, the end of the second alternating great tackle is then\n", "hooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber, in order to prepare for\n", "what follows. Whereupon, this accomplished swordsman, warning all hands\n", "to stand off, once more makes a scientific dash at the mass, and with a\n", "few sidelong, desperate, lunging slicings, severs it completely in\n", "twain; so that while the short lower part is still fast, the long upper\n", "strip, called a blanket-piece, swings clear, and is all ready for\n", "lowering. The heavers forward now resume their song, and while the one\n", "tackle is peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale, the other\n", "is slowly slackened away, and down goes the first strip through the\n", "main hatchway right beneath, into an unfurnished parlor called the\n", "blubber-room. Into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep\n", "coiling away the long blanket-piece as if it were a great live mass of\n", "plaited serpents.

That same infinitely thin, isinglass substance, which, I\n", "admit, invests the entire body of the whale, is not so much to be\n", "regarded as the skin of the creature, as the skin of the skin, so to\n", "speak; for it were simply ridiculous to say, that the proper skin of\n", "the tremendous whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a\n", "new-born child. But no more of this.\n", "\n", "Assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale; then, when this skin,\n", "as in the case of a very large Sperm Whale, will yield the bulk of one\n", "hundred barrels of oil; and, when it is considered that, in quantity,\n", "or rather weight, that oil, in its expressed state, is only three\n", "fourths, and not the entire substance of the coat; some idea may hence\n", "be had of the enormousness of that animated mass, a mere part of whose\n", "mere integument yields such a lake of liquid as that.

In a word, you would have two backs, so to speak; but, at the\n", "same time, also, two fronts (side fronts): for what is it that makes\n", "the front of a man\u2014what, indeed, but his eyes?\n", "\n", "Moreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the eyes\n", "are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so as to\n", "produce one picture and not two to the brain; the peculiar position of\n", "the whale\u2019s eyes, effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of\n", "solid head, which towers between them like a great mountain separating\n", "two lakes in valleys; this, of course, must wholly separate the\n", "impressions which each independent organ imparts. The whale, therefore,\n", "must see one distinct picture on this side, and another distinct\n", "picture on that side; while all between must be profound darkness and\n", "nothingness to him. Man may, in effect, be said to look out on the\n", "world from a sentry-box with two joined sashes for his window. But with\n", "the whale, these two sashes are separately inserted, making two\n", "distinct windows, but sadly impairing the view. This peculiarity of the\n", "whale\u2019s eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery; and\n", "to be remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes.\n", "\n", "A curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this\n", "visual matter as touching the Leviathan. But I must be content with a\n", "hint. So long as a man\u2019s eyes are open in the light, the act of seeing\n", "is involuntary; that is, he cannot then help mechanically seeing\n", "whatever objects are before him. Nevertheless, any one\u2019s experience\n", "will teach him, that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of\n", "things at one glance, it is quite impossible for him, attentively, and\n", "completely, to examine any two things\u2014however large or however small\u2014at\n", "one and the same instant of time; never mind if they lie side by side\n", "and touch each other. But if you now come to separate these two\n", "objects, and surround each by a circle of profound darkness; then, in\n", "order to see one of them, in such a manner as to bring your mind to\n", "bear on it, the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary\n", "consciousness. How is it, then, with the whale? True, both his eyes, in\n", "themselves, must simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more\n", "comprehensive, combining, and subtle than man\u2019s, that he can at the\n", "same moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on\n", "one side of him, and the other in an exactly opposite direction?

As when by unseen hands the water is\n", "gradually drawn off from some mighty fountain, and with half-stifled\n", "melancholy gurglings the spray-column lowers and lowers to the\n", "ground\u2014so the last long dying spout of the whale.\n", "\n", "Soon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship, the body\n", "showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled.\n", "Immediately, by Starbuck\u2019s orders, lines were secured to it at\n", "different points, so that ere long every boat was a buoy; the sunken\n", "whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords.

Aye, aye,\u201d cried Queequeg, and seizing the carpenter\u2019s heavy\n", "hatchet, he leaned out of a porthole, and steel to iron, began slashing\n", "at the largest fluke-chains.

It is not\n", "necessary, hints the Bishop, that we consider Jonah as tombed in the\n", "whale\u2019s belly, but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth.

Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their\n", "gills, the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times\n", "is combined with the element in which they swim; hence, a herring or a\n", "cod might live a century, and never once raise its head above the\n", "surface. But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him\n", "regular lungs, like a human being\u2019s, the whale can only live by\n", "inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere. Wherefore the\n", "necessity for his periodical visits to the upper world. But he cannot\n", "in any degree breathe through his mouth, for, in his ordinary attitude,\n", "the Sperm Whale\u2019s mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath the\n", "surface; and what is still more, his windpipe has no connexion with his\n", "mouth. No, he breathes through his spiracle alone; and this is on the\n", "top of his head.\n", "\n", "If I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function\n", "indispensable to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a\n", "certain element, which being subsequently brought into contact with the\n", "blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle, I do not think I\n", "shall err; though I may possibly use some superfluous scientific words.\n", "Assume it, and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be\n", "aerated with one breath, he might then seal up his nostrils and not\n", "fetch another for a considerable time. That is to say, he would then\n", "live without breathing. Anomalous as it may seem, this is precisely the\n", "case with the whale, who systematically lives, by intervals, his full\n", "hour and more (when at the bottom) without drawing a single breath, or\n", "so much as in any way inhaling a particle of air; for, remember, he has\n", "no gills. How is this? Between his ribs and on each side of his spine\n", "he is supplied with a remarkable involved Cretan labyrinth of\n", "vermicelli-like vessels, which vessels, when he quits the surface, are\n", "completely distended with oxygenated blood. So that for an hour or\n", "more, a thousand fathoms in the sea, he carries a surplus stock of\n", "vitality in him, just as the camel crossing the waterless desert\n", "carries a surplus supply of drink for future use in its four\n", "supplementary stomachs. The anatomical fact of this labyrinth is\n", "indisputable; and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable\n", "and true, seems the more cogent to me, when I consider the otherwise\n", "inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in _having his spoutings out_,\n", "as the fishermen phrase it. This is what I mean. If unmolested, upon\n", "rising to the surface, the Sperm Whale will continue there for a period\n", "of time exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings. Say he\n", "stays eleven minutes, and jets seventy times, that is, respires seventy\n", "breaths; then whenever he rises again, he will be sure to have his\n", "seventy breaths over again, to a minute. Now, if after he fetches a few\n", "breaths you alarm him, so that he sounds, he will be always dodging up\n", "again to make good his regular allowance of air. And not till those\n", "seventy breaths are told, will he finally go down to stay out his full\n", "term below. Remark, however, that in different individuals these rates\n", "are different; but in any one they are alike. Now, why should the whale\n", "thus insist upon having his spoutings out, unless it be to replenish\n", "his reservoir of air, ere descending for good? How obvious is it, too,\n", "that this necessity for the whale\u2019s rising exposes him to all the fatal\n", "hazards of the chase. For not by hook or by net could this vast\n", "leviathan be caught, when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the\n", "sunlight. Not so much thy skill, then, O hunter, as the great\n", "necessities that strike the victory to thee!\n", "\n", "In man, breathing is incessantly going on\u2014one breath only serving for\n", "two or three pulsations; so that whatever other business he has to\n", "attend to, waking or sleeping, breathe he must, or die he will. But the\n", "Sperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday of his time.\n", "\n", "It has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole;\n", "if it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water,\n", "then I opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of\n", "smell seems obliterated in him; for the only thing about him that at\n", "all answers to his nose is that identical spout-hole; and being so\n", "clogged with two elements, it could not be expected to have the power\n", "of smelling. But owing to the mystery of the spout\u2014whether it be water\n", "or whether it be vapor\u2014no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at\n", "on this head. Sure it is, nevertheless, that the Sperm Whale has no\n", "proper olfactories. But what does he want of them? No roses, no\n", "violets, no Cologne-water in the sea.\n", "\n", "Furthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting\n", "canal, and as that long canal\u2014like the grand Erie Canal\u2014is furnished\n", "with a sort of locks (that open and shut) for the downward retention of\n", "air or the upward exclusion of water, therefore the whale has no voice;\n", "unless you insult him by saying, that when he so strangely rumbles, he\n", "talks through his nose. But then again, what has the whale to say?\n", "Seldom have I known any profound being that had anything to say to this\n", "world, unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a\n", "living. Oh! happy that the world is such an excellent listener!\n", "\n", "Now, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it is\n", "for the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along,\n", "horizontally, just beneath the upper surface of his head, and a little\n", "to one side; this curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe laid down\n", "in a city on one side of a street. But the question returns whether\n", "this gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words, whether the spout\n", "of the Sperm Whale is the mere vapor of the exhaled breath, or whether\n", "that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth, and\n", "discharged through the spiracle. It is certain that the mouth\n", "indirectly communicates with the spouting canal; but it cannot be\n", "proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water through the\n", "spiracle. Because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be,\n", "when in feeding he accidentally takes in water. But the Sperm Whale\u2019s\n", "food is far beneath the surface, and there he cannot spout even if he\n", "would. Besides, if you regard him very closely, and time him with your\n", "watch, you will find that when unmolested, there is an undeviating\n", "rhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of\n", "respiration.\n", "\n", "But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject? Speak out!\n", "You have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can you not\n", "tell water from air? My dear sir, in this world it is not so easy to\n", "settle these plain things. I have ever found your plain things the\n", "knottiest of all. And as for this whale spout, you might almost stand\n", "in it, and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely.\n", "\n", "The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping\n", "it; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it,\n", "when, always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view\n", "of his spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water cascading all\n", "around him. And if at such times you should think that you really\n", "perceived drops of moisture in the spout, how do you know that they are\n", "not merely condensed from its vapor; or how do you know that they are\n", "not those identical drops superficially lodged in the spout-hole\n", "fissure, which is countersunk into the summit of the whale\u2019s head? For\n", "even when tranquilly swimming through the mid-day sea in a calm, with\n", "his elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary\u2019s in the desert; even then,\n", "the whale always carries a small basin of water on his head, as under a\n", "blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with\n", "rain.\n", "\n", "Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the\n", "precise nature of the whale spout. It will not do for him to be peering\n", "into it, and putting his face in it. You cannot go with your pitcher to\n", "this fountain and fill it, and bring it away. For even when coming into\n", "slight contact with the outer, vapory shreds of the jet, which will\n", "often happen, your skin will feverishly smart, from the acridness of\n", "the thing so touching it. And I know one, who coming into still closer\n", "contact with the spout, whether with some scientific object in view, or\n", "otherwise, I cannot say, the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm.\n", "Wherefore, among whalemen, the spout is deemed poisonous; they try to\n", "evade it. Another thing; I have heard it said, and I do not much doubt\n", "it, that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind\n", "you. The wisest thing the investigator can do then, it seems to me, is\n", "to let this deadly spout alone.\n", "\n", "Still, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot prove and establish. My\n", "hypothesis is this: that the spout is nothing but mist. And besides\n", "other reasons, to this conclusion I am impelled, by considerations\n", "touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm Whale; I\n", "account him no common, shallow being, inasmuch as it is an undisputed\n", "fact that he is never found on soundings, or near shores; all other\n", "whales sometimes are. He is both ponderous and profound. And I am\n", "convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings, such as\n", "Plato, Pyrrho, the Devil, Jupiter, Dante, and so on, there always goes\n", "up a certain semi-visible steam, while in the act of thinking deep\n", "thoughts. While composing a little treatise on Eternity, I had the\n", "curiosity to place a mirror before me; and ere long saw reflected\n", "there, a curious involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere over\n", "my head. The invariable moisture of my hair, while plunged in deep\n", "thought, after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic, of an\n", "August noon; this seems an additional argument for the above\n", "supposition.\n", "\n", "And how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster, to\n", "behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea; his vast, mild\n", "head overhung by a canopy of vapor, engendered by his incommunicable\n", "contemplations, and that vapor\u2014as you will sometimes see it\u2014glorified\n", "by a rainbow, as if Heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts.\n", "For, d\u2019ye see, rainbows do not visit the clear air; they only irradiate\n", "vapor.

And for this I thank God; for all have doubts; many deny;\n", "but doubts or denials, few along with them, have intuitions.

Nor were the oarsmen quite idle, though their\n", "wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with. They chiefly attended to\n", "the shouting part of the business. \u201cOut of the way, Commodore!\u201d cried\n", "one, to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface,\n", "and for an instant threatened to swamp us. \u201cHard down with your tail,\n", "there!\u201d cried a second to another, which, close to our gunwale, seemed\n", "calmly cooling himself with his own fan-like extremity.\n", "\n", "All whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally invented\n", "by the Nantucket Indians, called druggs.

On both sides the sea\n", "came in at the wounded planks, but we stuffed two or three drawers and\n", "shirts in, and so stopped the leaks for the time.\n", "\n", "It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were it\n", "not that as we advanced into the herd, our whale\u2019s way greatly\n", "diminished; moreover, that as we went still further and further from\n", "the circumference of commotion, the direful disorders seemed waning. So\n", "that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out, and the towing whale\n", "sideways vanished; then, with the tapering force of his parting\n", "momentum, we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of the\n", "shoal, as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene\n", "valley lake. Here the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost\n", "whales, were heard but not felt. In this central expanse the sea\n", "presented that smooth satin-like surface, called a sleek, produced by\n", "the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more quiet moods.\n", "Yes, we were now in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the\n", "heart of every commotion. And still in the distracted distance we\n", "beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles, and saw successive\n", "pods of whales, eight or ten in each, swiftly going round and round,\n", "like multiplied spans of horses in a ring; and so closely shoulder to\n", "shoulder, that a Titanic circus-rider might easily have over-arched the\n", "middle ones, and so have gone round on their backs. Owing to the\n", "density of the crowd of reposing whales, more immediately surrounding\n", "the embayed axis of the herd, no possible chance of escape was at\n", "present afforded us. We must watch for a breach in the living wall that\n", "hemmed us in; the wall that had only admitted us in order to shut us\n", "up. Keeping at the centre of the lake, we were occasionally visited by\n", "small tame cows and calves; the women and children of this routed host.\n", "\n", "Now, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving\n", "outer circles, and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in\n", "any one of those circles, the entire area at this juncture, embraced by\n", "the whole multitude, must have contained at least two or three square\n", "miles. At any rate\u2014though indeed such a test at such a time might be\n", "deceptive\u2014spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that seemed\n", "playing up almost from the rim of the horizon.

Like\n", "household dogs they came snuffling round us, right up to our gunwales,\n", "and touching them; till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly\n", "domesticated them. Queequeg patted their foreheads; Starbuck scratched\n", "their backs with his lance; but fearful of the consequences, for the\n", "time refrained from darting it.\n", "\n", "But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another and still\n", "stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side. For, suspended\n", "in those watery vaults, floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the\n", "whales, and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become\n", "mothers.

Elsewhere in this volume the slanderous\n", "aspersion has been disproved, that the vocation of whaling is\n", "throughout a slatternly, untidy business. But there is another thing to\n", "rebut.

The consequence is, that upon breaking\n", "into the hold, and unloading one of these whale cemeteries, in the\n", "Greenland dock, a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising\n", "from excavating an old city grave-yard, for the foundations of a\n", "Lying-in Hospital.\n", "\n", "I partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be\n", "likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland, in former\n", "times, of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg, which\n", "latter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack, in his great\n", "work on Smells, a text-book on that subject. As its name imports\n", "(smeer, fat; berg, to put up), this village was founded in order to\n", "afford a place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to be tried\n", "out, without being taken home to Holland for that purpose. It was a\n", "collection of furnaces, fat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when the works\n", "were in full operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor. But\n", "all this is quite different with a South Sea Sperm Whaler; which in a\n", "voyage of four years perhaps, after completely filling her hold with\n", "oil, does not, perhaps, consume fifty days in the business of boiling\n", "out; and in the state that it is casked, the oil is nearly scentless.\n", "The truth is, that living or dead, if but decently treated, whales as a\n", "species are by no means creatures of ill odor; nor can whalemen be\n", "recognised, as the people of the middle ages affected to detect a Jew\n", "in the company, by the nose.

But let us to the story.\n", "\n", "It came to pass, that in the ambergris affair Stubb\u2019s after-oarsman\n", "chanced so to sprain his hand, as for a time to become quite maimed;\n", "and, temporarily, Pip was put into his place.\n", "\n", "The first time Stubb lowered with him, Pip evinced much nervousness;\n", "but happily, for that time, escaped close contact with the whale; and\n", "therefore came off not altogether discreditably; though Stubb observing\n", "him, took care, afterwards, to exhort him to cherish his courageousness\n", "to the utmost, for he might often find it needful.\n", "\n", "Now upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; and as\n", "the fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which\n", "happened, in this instance, to be right under poor Pip\u2019s seat. The\n", "involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle in\n", "hand, out of the boat; and in such a way, that part of the slack whale\n", "line coming against his chest, he breasted it overboard with him, so as\n", "to become entangled in it, when at last plumping into the water. That\n", "instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the line swiftly\n", "straightened; and presto! poor Pip came all foaming up to the chocks of\n", "the boat, remorselessly dragged there by the line, which had taken\n", "several turns around his chest and neck.\n", "\n", "Tashtego stood in the bows. He was full of the fire of the hunt. He\n", "hated Pip for a poltroon. Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath, he\n", "suspended its sharp edge over the line, and turning towards Stubb,\n", "exclaimed interrogatively, \u201cCut?\u201d Meantime Pip\u2019s blue, choked face\n", "plainly looked, Do, for God\u2019s sake! All passed in a flash. In less than\n", "half a minute, this entire thing happened.\n", "\n", "\u201cDamn him, cut!\u201d roared Stubb; and so the whale was lost and Pip was\n", "saved.\n", "\n", "So soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was assailed by\n", "yells and execrations from the crew. Tranquilly permitting these\n", "irregular cursings to evaporate, Stubb then in a plain, business-like,\n", "but still half humorous manner, cursed Pip officially; and that done,\n", "unofficially gave him much wholesome advice. The substance was, Never\n", "jump from a boat, Pip, except\u2014but all the rest was indefinite, as the\n", "soundest advice ever is. Now, in general, _Stick to the boat_, is your\n", "true motto in whaling; but cases will sometimes happen when _Leap from\n", "the boat_, is still better. Moreover, as if perceiving at last that if\n", "he should give undiluted conscientious advice to Pip, he would be\n", "leaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly\n", "dropped all advice, and concluded with a peremptory command, \u201cStick to\n", "the boat, Pip, or by the Lord, I won\u2019t pick you up if you jump; mind\n", "that. We can\u2019t afford to lose whales by the likes of you; a whale would\n", "sell for thirty times what you would, Pip, in Alabama. Bear that in\n", "mind, and don\u2019t jump any more.\u201d Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted,\n", "that though man loved his fellow, yet man is a money-making animal,\n", "which propensity too often interferes with his benevolence.\n", "\n", "But we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again. It was\n", "under very similar circumstances to the first performance; but this\n", "time he did not breast out the line; and hence, when the whale started\n", "to run, Pip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried traveller\u2019s\n", "trunk. Alas! Stubb was but too true to his word. It was a beautiful,\n", "bounteous, blue day; the spangled sea calm and cool, and flatly\n", "stretching away, all round, to the horizon, like gold-beater\u2019s skin\n", "hammered out to the extremest. Bobbing up and down in that sea, Pip\u2019s\n", "ebon head showed like a head of cloves. No boat-knife was lifted when\n", "he fell so rapidly astern. Stubb\u2019s inexorable back was turned upon him;\n", "and the whale was winged. In three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless\n", "ocean was between Pip and Stubb. Out from the centre of the sea, poor\n", "Pip turned his crisp, curling, black head to the sun, another lonely\n", "castaway, though the loftiest and the brightest.\n", "\n", "Now, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the\n", "practised swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore. But the awful\n", "lonesomeness is intolerable. The intense concentration of self in the\n", "middle of such a heartless immensity, my God! who can tell it? Mark,\n", "how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea\u2014mark how closely\n", "they hug their ship and only coast along her sides.\n", "\n", "But had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate? No;\n", "he did not mean to, at least. Because there were two boats in his wake,\n", "and he supposed, no doubt, that they would of course come up to Pip\n", "very quickly, and pick him up; though, indeed, such considerations\n", "towards oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity, is not always\n", "manifested by the hunters in all similar instances; and such instances\n", "not unfrequently occur; almost invariably in the fishery, a coward, so\n", "called, is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to\n", "military navies and armies.\n", "\n", "But it so happened, that those boats, without seeing Pip, suddenly\n", "spying whales close to them on one side, turned, and gave chase; and\n", "Stubb\u2019s boat was now so far away, and he and all his crew so intent\n", "upon his fish, that Pip\u2019s ringed horizon began to expand around him\n", "miserably. By the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him;\n", "but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot; such,\n", "at least, they said he was. The sea had jeeringly kept his finite body\n", "up, but drowned the infinite of his soul. Not drowned entirely, though.\n", "Rather carried down alive to wondrous depths, where strange shapes of\n", "the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes;\n", "and the miser-merman, Wisdom, revealed his hoarded heaps; and among the\n", "joyous, heartless, ever-juvenile eternities, Pip saw the multitudinous,\n", "God-omnipresent, coral insects, that out of the firmament of waters\n", "heaved the colossal orbs. He saw God\u2019s foot upon the treadle of the\n", "loom, and spoke it; and therefore his shipmates called him mad. So\n", "man\u2019s insanity is heaven\u2019s sense; and wandering from all mortal reason,\n", "man comes at last to that celestial thought, which, to reason, is\n", "absurd and frantic; and weal or woe, feels then uncompromised,\n", "indifferent as his God.\n", "\n", "For the rest, blame not Stubb too hardly.

The Try-Works.\n", "\n", "Besides her hoisted boats, an American whaler is outwardly\n", "distinguished by her try-works.

The\n", "foundation does not penetrate the deck, but the masonry is firmly\n", "secured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all\n", "sides, and screwing it down to the timbers. On the flanks it is cased\n", "with wood, and at top completely covered by a large, sloping, battened\n", "hatchway. Removing this hatch we expose the great try-pots, two in\n", "number, and each of several barrels\u2019 capacity. When not in use, they\n", "are kept remarkably clean. Sometimes they are polished with soapstone\n", "and sand, till they shine within like silver punch-bowls.

But, spite of all\n", "this, I could see no compass before me to steer by; though it seemed\n", "but a minute since I had been watching the card, by the steady binnacle\n", "lamp illuminating it. Nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom, now and\n", "then made ghastly by flashes of redness. Uppermost was the impression,\n", "that whatever swift, rushing thing I stood on was not so much bound to\n", "any haven ahead as rushing from all havens astern. A stark, bewildered\n", "feeling, as of death, came over me.

Lo! in my brief sleep I had turned myself about, and was\n", "fronting the ship\u2019s stern, with my back to her prow and the compass.

Never dream with thy\n", "hand on the helm!

Such a statement may prove useful here.\n", "\n", "According to a careful calculation I have made, and which I partly base\n", "upon Captain Scoresby\u2019s estimate, of seventy tons for the largest sized\n", "Greenland whale of sixty feet in length; according to my careful\n", "calculation, I say, a Sperm Whale of the largest magnitude, between\n", "eighty-five and ninety feet in length, and something less than forty\n", "feet in its fullest circumference, such a whale will weigh at least\n", "ninety tons; so that, reckoning thirteen men to a ton, he would\n", "considerably outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one\n", "thousand one hundred inhabitants.\n", "\n", "Think you not then that brains, like yoked cattle, should be put to\n", "this leviathan, to make him at all budge to any landsman\u2019s imagination?\n", "\n", "Having already in various ways put before you his skull, spout-hole,\n", "jaw, teeth, tail, forehead, fins, and divers other parts, I shall now\n", "simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his\n", "unobstructed bones. But as the colossal skull embraces so very large a\n", "proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton; as it is by far the\n", "most complicated part; and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it\n", "in this chapter, you must not fail to carry it in your mind, or under\n", "your arm, as we proceed, otherwise you will not gain a complete notion\n", "of the general structure we are about to view.\n", "\n", "In length, the Sperm Whale\u2019s skeleton at Tranque measured seventy-two\n", "feet; so that when fully invested and extended in life, he must have\n", "been ninety feet long; for in the whale, the skeleton loses about one\n", "fifth in length compared with the living body. Of this seventy-two\n", "feet, his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet, leaving some fifty\n", "feet of plain back-bone. Attached to this back-bone, for something less\n", "than a third of its length, was the mighty circular basket of ribs\n", "which once enclosed his vitals.\n", "\n", "To me this vast ivory-ribbed chest, with the long, unrelieved spine,\n", "extending far away from it in a straight line, not a little resembled\n", "the hull of a great ship new-laid upon the stocks, when only some\n", "twenty of her naked bow-ribs are inserted, and the keel is otherwise,\n", "for the time, but a long, disconnected timber.\n", "\n", "The ribs were ten on a side. The first, to begin from the neck, was\n", "nearly six feet long; the second, third, and fourth were each\n", "successively longer, till you came to the climax of the fifth, or one\n", "of the middle ribs, which measured eight feet and some inches. From\n", "that part, the remaining ribs diminished, till the tenth and last only\n", "spanned five feet and some inches. In general thickness, they all bore\n", "a seemly correspondence to their length. The middle ribs were the most\n", "arched. In some of the Arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay\n", "footpath bridges over small streams.\n", "\n", "In considering these ribs, I could not but be struck anew with the\n", "circumstance, so variously repeated in this book, that the skeleton of\n", "the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form. The largest of\n", "the Tranque ribs, one of the middle ones, occupied that part of the\n", "fish which, in life, is greatest in depth. Now, the greatest depth of\n", "the invested body of this particular whale must have been at least\n", "sixteen feet; whereas, the corresponding rib measured but little more\n", "than eight feet. So that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion\n", "of the living magnitude of that part. Besides, for some way, where I\n", "now saw but a naked spine, all that had been once wrapped round with\n", "tons of added bulk in flesh, muscle, blood, and bowels. Still more, for\n", "the ample fins, I here saw but a few disordered joints; and in place of\n", "the weighty and majestic, but boneless flukes, an utter blank!\n", "\n", "How vain and foolish, then, thought I, for timid untravelled man to try\n", "to comprehend aright this wondrous whale, by merely poring over his\n", "dead attenuated skeleton, stretched in this peaceful wood. No. Only in\n", "the heart of quickest perils; only when within the eddyings of his\n", "angry flukes; only on the profound unbounded sea, can the fully\n", "invested whale be truly and livingly found out.\n", "\n", "But the spine. For that, the best way we can consider it is, with a\n", "crane, to pile its bones high up on end. No speedy enterprise. But now\n", "it\u2019s done, it looks much like Pompey\u2019s Pillar.\n", "\n", "There are forty and odd vertebr\u00e6 in all, which in the skeleton are not\n", "locked together. They mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on a\n", "Gothic spire, forming solid courses of heavy masonry. The largest, a\n", "middle one, is in width something less than three feet, and in depth\n", "more than four. The smallest, where the spine tapers away into the\n", "tail, is only two inches in width, and looks something like a white\n", "billiard-ball. I was told that there were still smaller ones, but they\n", "had been lost by some little cannibal urchins, the priest\u2019s children,\n", "who had stolen them to play marbles with. Thus we see how that the\n", "spine of even the hugest of living things tapers off at last into\n", "simple child\u2019s play.\n", "\n", "\n", "CHAPTER 104. The Fossil Whale.\n", "\n", "From his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon\n", "to enlarge, amplify, and generally expatiate. Would you, you could not\n", "compress him.
