       "      <td>the problem with being a high school student with average intelligence is that you can get fairly good grades with fairly minimal effort. it is an invitation to cut corners and utilize only one half your ass. this happened to me in english class. i'd sit back, take good notes, and bluff my way through various tests (this was back in the day before google, when my family only had an aol dial-up connection and all the answers, right and wrong, were on the internet). for these sins, i am now fated to read the classics long after i was supposed to read them. on the plus side, coming to the classics on my own volition gives me a better appreciation than having to read them with a figurative gun to the head. this has allowed me to enjoy certain works to a higher degree.however, i don't think any number of years will allow me to appreciate or enjoy or even suffer fyodor dostoevsky's crime and punishment. first published in 1866, crime and punishment is the excruciatingly-detailed psycho-epic about the murder of a pawn shop owner (and her sister). the murderer is named raskolnikov. he is a former student living in a wretched little closet apartment. he is utterly unlikable: smug, arrogant, temperamental, condescending and self-delusional. today, we would recognize this person as having a serious mental illness (and the book would be called inability to form criminal intent and involuntary commitment instead of crime and punishment). dostoevsky, though, presents raskolnikov's malady as spiritual, rather than mental. in a way, he is just like every grad student you've ever met: shiftless; over-educated and under-employed; haughty, yet prone to bouts of self-loathing. i imagine if this book was written in the next century, raskolnikov would have shaggy sideburns, wear a t-shirt emblazoned with che's image, and have a well-hidden addiction to prescription pain pills. raskolnikov has some interesting theories. he's a nietzsche-inspired pre-nazi who believes that the world can be divided into two classes: an elite, napoleonic class, free to do what they wish; and a second class comprised of everyone else. this former class, because of their elevated standing, don't have to follow the rules. armed with this self-serving worldview, raskolnikov, in need of money, determines that the pawn broker alyona ivanovna is a louse who deserves to die. so he takes his axe and a fake pledge to her apartment and bashes her head in. the crime is suitably graphic: he took the axe all the way out, swung it with both hands, scarcely aware of himself, and almost without effort...brought the butt-end down on her head...because she was short, the blow happened to land right on the crown of her head. she cried out, but very faintly, and her whole body suddenly sank to the floor, though she still managed to raise both hands to her head...then he struck her again and yet again with all his strength...blood poured out as from an overturned glass...once the murder is complete, very early in the novel, the long, slow, excruciating psychological unraveling begins. some of raskolnikov's madness is displayed through seemingly-endless internal monologues. is this what it's like to be a crazy person? maybe, maybe not. but it's effective in its way, because it drove me insane reading it. raskolnikov's deterioration is also presented via his relationships. despite being an utter jackass, he has a lot of friends and family who care for him. among them is the doting natasha, a housekeeper at raskolnikov's apartment; a doctor named zossimov; and raskolnikov's \"best friend\" razumikhin. razumikhin reminds me of a more-refined milhouse from the simpsons. he looks after raskolnikov, tries to get him a job, and suffers all raskolnikov's verbal abuse with unflagging patience. i couldn't decide what annoyed me more: raskolnikov's monomania or razumikhin's spinelessness. complicating this picture are several uninteresting plot threads that eventually, finally, after hundreds of pages, merge. one thread deals with marmeladov, a wrecked old drunk whose daughter, sonia, is a prostitute (with a heart of gold!). raskolnikov is eventually redeemed by sonia and sonia's faith. a second thread has to do with raskolnikov's mother and sister. his sister, dunya, has come to st. petersburg under a cloud, though things are looking brighter for her and the family, as she is engaged to luzhin. luzhin has money, and a keen eye for beautiful, vulnerable women. raskolnikov rightly senses luzhin's ill intent, and the animosity between the two men does not help raskolnikov's troubled mind. on top of all this, there is a clever, dickensian police inspector named porfiry petrovich. he knows immediately that raskolnikov is the murderer, yet insists on playing a lame game of cat-and-mouse. one of the few enjoyments i got from this novel was the cold irony of a russian police officer patiently waiting for his suspect to confess. in dostoevsky's russia, the law is clever, intelligent, and implacable. of course, just a few decades later, the nkvd and kgb would be breaking down doors in the middle of the night and hustling people off to siberia for no reason at all. to dostoevsky's credit, all these characters intertwine, and all the stories pay off, such as it is. in order to do so, however, there are plot contrivances piled atop plot contrivances. dostoevsky relies heavily on characters overhearing important bits of information. the only russian novels i've read have been by tolstoy, so i don't have much to compare this to. i'm not fit to analyze crime and punishment against other works of russian literature, or even against dostoevsky's other books. all i know was that this was a drag to read. there are paragraphs that go on for pages, and the density - unleavened by any action - is numbing. one of the most common complaints when reading russian literature is the names. it's almost become a cliche. well, in this case, it's true. at least tolstoy gave his characters american nicknames. here, you have to deal with both the patronymics and identical-sounding or near-identically-named characters. the easiest task you have is not mixing up raskolnikov with razumikhin. it gets a little harder trying to keep alyona ivanovna (the pawnbroker), katerina ivanovna (sonia's mother) and amalia ivanovna (sonia's mother's landlord) straight. also remember that dunya goes by the name dunechka or avdotya romanovna (but that porfiry petrovich is not the same as ilya petrovich). more confusing than the names is the culture shock. when i first tried to read crime and punishment in high school, i chalked my confusion up to a poor translation. well, this time around, the translation is in the incredibly capable hands of richard pevear and larissa volokhonsky. they managed, in anna karenina and war and peace to be both faithful and readable. here, again, i have no complaints with the translation; but i also had a revelation: i don't get russians. i don't fully grasp their social hierarchy; i don't get why they like mustaches on women; and i certainly don't understand their interactions. they get mad for reasons i can't comprehend; they are insulted for reasons i do not fathom. in dostoevsky's hands, russians are a bunch of operatic drama queens, incapable of having a subtle or nuanced reaction to anything. every emotion has an exclamation mark. you get dunya trying to shoot svidrigailov one second, and then tearfully embracing him the next. characters fall on their knees before each other, and laugh at inappropriate times, and have opaque motivations. i say this with all cultural sensitivity: russians are a bunch of weirdos. despite all its length and detail, i found dostoevsky's psychology simplistic, and the ending pat. and i say this fully realizing i might come across as a philistine. of course, there are enjoyable moments, including a classic set-piece following marmeladov's funeral (imagine a russian version of clue, in which accusations are followed by counter-accusations, and everyone is shouting and fainting). surprisingly, there is also a good bit of humor, such as this interaction between raskolnikov and svidrigailov regarding the morality of eavesdropping: in that case, go and tell the authorities; say thus and so, i've had this mishap: there was a little mistake in my theory. but if you're convinced that one cannot eavesdrop at doors, but can go around whacking old crones with whatever comes to hand, to your heart's content, then leave quickly for america somewhere!or svidrigailov on women: depravity! well, listen to that! however, for the sake of order, i'll answer you first about women in general; you know, i'm inclined to be talkative. tell me, why should i restrain myself? why should i give up women, if i'm fond of them? at least it's an occupation.indeed!finally, there is a certain precision in the character observations that transcends their unfamiliar interactions. the characters - in their thoughts, beliefs, and self-delusions - are admirably rendered and universally recognizable.</td>\n",

(for some reason i think of adam sandler. i believe he once commented with pride that he did not finish high school.) surely people all know, in this day and age, that \"serenity\" is not a viable goal in life? that the best we can do is meet the challenges as they come, acknowledge that life is always a struggle, and find reasons to continue the struggle? surely people don't fall for this dully polished hogwash, already dreadfully unoriginal by 1903? doesn't the pompousness, the selfishness, the sheer vacuity of allen's thinking show through?sadly, there truly is no end to how gullible readers can be. i suppose when you combine basic ignorance with the anxiety and ambivalence we all feel these days (trust me i feel it too) then the result is that a large part of the population will continue to purchase the age-old idea that \"right thoughts\" will change the world. that's why brian johnson can live the glamorous, self-oriented life of a \"ceo.\" that's why allen's 1903 text is plastered all over the internet, from wikipedia to project gutenberg and so on and so forth. i've hit on yet another node of the most compelling fantasy that exists in this market-and-work oriented world. \"there's a sucker born every minute.\" - p.t. barnum (died 1891)</td>\n",

       "75656   the problem with being a high school student with average intelligence is that you can get fairly good grades with fairly minimal effort. it is an invitation to cut corners and utilize only one half your ass. this happened to me in english class. i'd sit back, take good notes, and bluff my way through various tests (this was back in the day before google, when my family only had an aol dial-up connection and all the answers, right and wrong, were on the internet). for these sins, i am now fated to read the classics long after i was supposed to read them. on the plus side, coming to the classics on my own volition gives me a better appreciation than having to read them with a figurative gun to the head. this has allowed me to enjoy certain works to a higher degree.however, i don't think any number of years will allow me to appreciate or enjoy or even suffer fyodor dostoevsky's crime and punishment. first published in 1866, crime and punishment is the excruciatingly-detailed psycho-epic about the murder of a pawn shop owner (and her sister). the murderer is named raskolnikov. he is a former student living in a wretched little closet apartment. he is utterly unlikable: smug, arrogant, temperamental, condescending and self-delusional. today, we would recognize this person as having a serious mental illness (and the book would be called inability to form criminal intent and involuntary commitment instead of crime and punishment). dostoevsky, though, presents raskolnikov's malady as spiritual, rather than mental. in a way, he is just like every grad student you've ever met: shiftless; over-educated and under-employed; haughty, yet prone to bouts of self-loathing. i imagine if this book was written in the next century, raskolnikov would have shaggy sideburns, wear a t-shirt emblazoned with che's image, and have a well-hidden addiction to prescription pain pills. raskolnikov has some interesting theories. he's a nietzsche-inspired pre-nazi who believes that the world can be divided into two classes: an elite, napoleonic class, free to do what they wish; and a second class comprised of everyone else. this former class, because of their elevated standing, don't have to follow the rules. armed with this self-serving worldview, raskolnikov, in need of money, determines that the pawn broker alyona ivanovna is a louse who deserves to die. so he takes his axe and a fake pledge to her apartment and bashes her head in. the crime is suitably graphic: he took the axe all the way out, swung it with both hands, scarcely aware of himself, and almost without effort...brought the butt-end down on her head...because she was short, the blow happened to land right on the crown of her head. she cried out, but very faintly, and her whole body suddenly sank to the floor, though she still managed to raise both hands to her head...then he struck her again and yet again with all his strength...blood poured out as from an overturned glass...once the murder is complete, very early in the novel, the long, slow, excruciating psychological unraveling begins. some of raskolnikov's madness is displayed through seemingly-endless internal monologues. is this what it's like to be a crazy person? maybe, maybe not. but it's effective in its way, because it drove me insane reading it. raskolnikov's deterioration is also presented via his relationships. despite being an utter jackass, he has a lot of friends and family who care for him. among them is the doting natasha, a housekeeper at raskolnikov's apartment; a doctor named zossimov; and raskolnikov's \"best friend\" razumikhin. razumikhin reminds me of a more-refined milhouse from the simpsons. he looks after raskolnikov, tries to get him a job, and suffers all raskolnikov's verbal abuse with unflagging patience. i couldn't decide what annoyed me more: raskolnikov's monomania or razumikhin's spinelessness. complicating this picture are several uninteresting plot threads that eventually, finally, after hundreds of pages, merge. one thread deals with marmeladov, a wrecked old drunk whose daughter, sonia, is a prostitute (with a heart of gold!). raskolnikov is eventually redeemed by sonia and sonia's faith. a second thread has to do with raskolnikov's mother and sister. his sister, dunya, has come to st. petersburg under a cloud, though things are looking brighter for her and the family, as she is engaged to luzhin. luzhin has money, and a keen eye for beautiful, vulnerable women. raskolnikov rightly senses luzhin's ill intent, and the animosity between the two men does not help raskolnikov's troubled mind. on top of all this, there is a clever, dickensian police inspector named porfiry petrovich. he knows immediately that raskolnikov is the murderer, yet insists on playing a lame game of cat-and-mouse. one of the few enjoyments i got from this novel was the cold irony of a russian police officer patiently waiting for his suspect to confess. in dostoevsky's russia, the law is clever, intelligent, and implacable. of course, just a few decades later, the nkvd and kgb would be breaking down doors in the middle of the night and hustling people off to siberia for no reason at all. to dostoevsky's credit, all these characters intertwine, and all the stories pay off, such as it is. in order to do so, however, there are plot contrivances piled atop plot contrivances. dostoevsky relies heavily on characters overhearing important bits of information. the only russian novels i've read have been by tolstoy, so i don't have much to compare this to. i'm not fit to analyze crime and punishment against other works of russian literature, or even against dostoevsky's other books. all i know was that this was a drag to read. there are paragraphs that go on for pages, and the density - unleavened by any action - is numbing. one of the most common complaints when reading russian literature is the names. it's almost become a cliche. well, in this case, it's true. at least tolstoy gave his characters american nicknames. here, you have to deal with both the patronymics and identical-sounding or near-identically-named characters. the easiest task you have is not mixing up raskolnikov with razumikhin. it gets a little harder trying to keep alyona ivanovna (the pawnbroker), katerina ivanovna (sonia's mother) and amalia ivanovna (sonia's mother's landlord) straight. also remember that dunya goes by the name dunechka or avdotya romanovna (but that porfiry petrovich is not the same as ilya petrovich). more confusing than the names is the culture shock. when i first tried to read crime and punishment in high school, i chalked my confusion up to a poor translation. well, this time around, the translation is in the incredibly capable hands of richard pevear and larissa volokhonsky. they managed, in anna karenina and war and peace to be both faithful and readable. here, again, i have no complaints with the translation; but i also had a revelation: i don't get russians. i don't fully grasp their social hierarchy; i don't get why they like mustaches on women; and i certainly don't understand their interactions. they get mad for reasons i can't comprehend; they are insulted for reasons i do not fathom. in dostoevsky's hands, russians are a bunch of operatic drama queens, incapable of having a subtle or nuanced reaction to anything. every emotion has an exclamation mark. you get dunya trying to shoot svidrigailov one second, and then tearfully embracing him the next. characters fall on their knees before each other, and laugh at inappropriate times, and have opaque motivations. i say this with all cultural sensitivity: russians are a bunch of weirdos. despite all its length and detail, i found dostoevsky's psychology simplistic, and the ending pat. and i say this fully realizing i might come across as a philistine. of course, there are enjoyable moments, including a classic set-piece following marmeladov's funeral (imagine a russian version of clue, in which accusations are followed by counter-accusations, and everyone is shouting and fainting). surprisingly, there is also a good bit of humor, such as this interaction between raskolnikov and svidrigailov regarding the morality of eavesdropping: in that case, go and tell the authorities; say thus and so, i've had this mishap: there was a little mistake in my theory. but if you're convinced that one cannot eavesdrop at doors, but can go around whacking old crones with whatever comes to hand, to your heart's content, then leave quickly for america somewhere!or svidrigailov on women: depravity! well, listen to that! however, for the sake of order, i'll answer you first about women in general; you know, i'm inclined to be talkative. tell me, why should i restrain myself? why should i give up women, if i'm fond of them? at least it's an occupation.indeed!finally, there is a certain precision in the character observations that transcends their unfamiliar interactions. the characters - in their thoughts, beliefs, and self-delusions - are admirably rendered and universally recognizable.    \n",

symbolism. its fun, because its set in that time of affluence. the characters are very interesting. even better read with some sort of commentary or cliff notes or an old high school english note book. there's some stuff you don't want to miss.    \n",

other than it was probably the first book ever to really introduce me to catholicism. i had so many questions about catholicism after reading this. being raised protestant i was shocked at the huge differece between the two and the fact that i could relate more to judaism or even islam than i could to another christian religion. it has probably served more to shape my views on catholicism than anything else...unfortunatley very negatively.   \n",

                                                          ugh. another classic that i found incredibly distasteful. again, i read it for english class in high school, so i know perfectly well about all the wonderful literary devices dickens is using and all that. really, though, the characters were completely one-dimensional, stereotypical even, no complexity to them at all, which made them pretty darn uninteresting to read about. ugh.   \n",

purpose becomes creative force.\" this is the basic idea behind all of james allen's sugary half-truths. when i found an audio file with this text pre-packaged into my new learnoutloud.com cart, read by \"brian johnson, philosopher and ceo of zaadz.com,\" i was briefly intrigued. then as i listened a bit more, i thought it was some kind of joke or parody -- surely in just a moment brian, \"philosopher,\" will put on a more genuine, critical voice. surely he would tell us that of course you can't change your circumstances with your thoughts. that's not philosophy, but magical thinking. surely he would remind us, as barbara erhenreich has tried to do, that perfectly virtuous people fail and suffer everyday. and that perfect scoundrals, animalistic beasts, succeed and prosper all the time. (for some reason i think of adam sandler. i believe he once commented with pride that he did not finish high school.) surely people all know, in this day and age, that \"serenity\" is not a viable goal in life? that the best we can do is meet the challenges as they come, acknowledge that life is always a struggle, and find reasons to continue the struggle? surely people don't fall for this dully polished hogwash, already dreadfully unoriginal by 1903? doesn't the pompousness, the selfishness, the sheer vacuity of allen's thinking show through?sadly, there truly is no end to how gullible readers can be. i suppose when you combine basic ignorance with the anxiety and ambivalence we all feel these days (trust me i feel it too) then the result is that a large part of the population will continue to purchase the age-old idea that \"right thoughts\" will change the world. that's why brian johnson can live the glamorous, self-oriented life of a \"ceo.\" that's why allen's 1903 text is plastered all over the internet, from wikipedia to project gutenberg and so on and so forth. i've hit on yet another node of the most compelling fantasy that exists in this market-and-work oriented world. \"there's a sucker born every minute.\" - p.t. barnum (died 1891)   \n",

like it, but i'm not sure i love it. i received this book as a gift from a former high school teacher of mine when i graduated from college. i'm not sure if he is hoping that he is my morrie, or what. i hope he was just hoping that i would like the life lessons in the story. and i do appreciate them very much. i've re-read this book a few times and it never fails to make me cry in certain parts...as if i don't know what is going to happen in the end. for those few of you who are unfamiliar with this book, it is about the relationship that the author has with a former professor of his after he hears that this professor has come down with a degenerative disease. it reads sort of like a journal as the author realizes more and more about the life he is living in comparison with the life of the man that he so admires. i've read some of the authors other work and it seems really forced to me. this work flows nicely and i would suggest it as a good read for anyone. although if you are sentimental, you should keep some tissues handy.    \n",

                                    jack is ernest in the city and claims when he is in the country to have a brother ernest in the city, although he plans to \"kill\" his \"brother\" off so theres no confusion for gwendolyn, his soon-to-be fiance and his buddy algernon's cousin. and gwendolyn could only love a man with the name of ernest. then algernon heads to the country deciding to play a trick on jack by becoming his \"brother\", ernest, only to fall for jack's ward, cecily, whos \"girlish dream\" has always been to marry a man called ernest. then jack shows up un-announced having come from his \"brother's funeral\", only to find algy there as \"ernest\"...thus begins the laughs and problems! then! what if one of the jolly ole chums truly was born with the name of ernest?! this is such a wonderful and classic pay, and i find it sad so many have never read it....why wasn't it a required book to read in high school?! even my grandma, who claims to have read a ton, doesn't know what i'm speaking of when i quote jack or the muffin scene!   \n",

herman hesse's demian in the summer after high school, then proceeded to read everything available by the author, even his collected newspaper articles, for the next couple of years.siddhartha, along with narcissus and goldmund and steppenwolf, is one of hesse's best and most accessible novels. hesse himself had grown up in a missionary family and, so, knew more about india and its religions than one might obtain from mere reading. still, this is very much a european novel, a romantic novel devoted to the theme which occupied the author throughout his life: the quest for true authenticity and wholeness.the character of protagonist is clearly distinguished from that of the historical buddha, but the story of his life, which includes some association with the buddha, markedly parallels it in terms understandable to western readers.    \n",

crammed into such a small book. also, a great use of anthropomorphism (i just wanted to use a big, fancy sounding word!)review wise, that is about all i need to say - it is great, read it!but, i will add this anecdote . . .i read this when i was in high school as required reading. most required reading books were long and not all that exciting (i am looking at you, jane eyre!) but, this one was so good that i couldn't put it down. and, since it is so short, i read it in one night. well, the teacher had assigned chapters and asked us not to read ahead. still hard to believe i got in trouble for reading too much of a required reading book!   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                         i remember disliking great expectations in high school, for reasons i couldn't identify then. now that i've read oliver twist years later, i realize why i don't like dickens.the writing style is clunky because of the long sentences with many commas. the fact that it was a serial before it was a novel is very apparent here, since there seems to be no editing to make the transition fit. in one instance, a character might die from an illness. oh no! a few pages later, and she's suddenly ok! that was pointless, and could have been cut without the reader noticing anything different. *last airbender spoilers*i guess this is often a problem when adapting serials to a novel or a film, since the last airbender movie has the same issue. the moon spirit is dead! the barely-developed princess character will sacrifice herself to bring back the moon spirit! the moon spirit is ok, and the waterbenders get their powers back in a few minutes! see what i mean? :) (though oliver twist is definitely better than that hilariously awful m. night shamalamadingdong movie)whenever dickens tries to make a joke, he then ruins it by explaining it. there's one joke about a dog to the effect of \"he's a regular christian!\" because it doesn't like other types of dogs. dickens then proceeds to tell the reader that yes, people who call themselves christians are often bigoted. if you make a good joke, then the reader would probably figure it out! *here be spoilers*speaking of bigotry, i know it's the nineteenth century, but does fagin really have to have every possible negative jewish stereotype? even the often-criticized shylock from a much earlier time probably has far more depth than fagin. at one point i thought \"dickens put in everything except for a nose joke\", and of course, a nose joke pops up later on. when mel brooks did the nose job joke in spaceballs, it was actually funny! here it comes off as mean-spirited.for a book called \"oliver twist\", the title character doesn't get to do a lot. even when he does the \"can i have some more?\" thing, it's because he drew the short straw rather than on his own initiative. that and beating up noah are the high points of his career, and both are very early in the novel. i thought things might get interesting when he might have to steal for fagin, but of course on the first robbery he's knocked out, and he therefore gets out of any wrongdoing. he's then mostly safe and out of the action for the rest of the book. this book should have been called \"fagin's gang\" or something instead.there's also a character who only exists in order to be sickeningly good and then die of illness. i guess this is a 19th century cliche, because it also appears in other dickens stuff as well as jane eyre (except jane eyre at least develops this character somewhat).overall, for a classic novel, it just didn't appeal to me much, and i was glad it was over when i finished. read the bronte sisters instead of dickens. their books give a lot of snarking material, but also have interesting well-developed characters.    \n",

read more than 25 years ago. i upgraded my review to 5 stars. i was struck by three things upon re-reading.1. the last three chapters of moby dick are three of the most thrilling chapters that i have ever read2. the level of humor that exists in the book, particularly the interactions between queequeg and ishmael, is quite striking especially for a book written more than a century and a half ago. i think the humor assists with the authenticity of the characters.3. the three dimensionality of ahab. he was drawn in a way that reminded me of another of my favorite characters, long john silver, from treasure island. i think quite simply that robert louis stevenson must have read moby dick, either that or all sea captains were like these two. my apologies to my high school lit teacher, mr. bryan, who was correct in stating that moby dick was a great novel. at the time, none of the class believed him. i guess it is hard to convince a bunch of teenagers until they have read a lot of other literature and maybe have seen a bit of life and its tragedies to understand. finally it is now obvious to me that this book was very personal to melville and he didn’t make most of it up. i strongly recommend nathaniel philbrick’s history in the heart of the sea: the tragedy of the whaleship essex which is a thrilling five star book in its own right. it is said that melville based moby dick in part on this real story of the whaleship essex.     \n",

class (ok, maybe only three). i hated this book so much when i read it, but i know that i don't hate the story because i was fine with watching the movie. but my 11th grade teacher just killed it, mangled it beyond recognition, and left it as something to be despised. i think high school teachers should have to pass some kind of test or something before they are allowed to inflict possible irrecoible damage on classics of literature through their piss poor pedeogical methods. the same teacher gave a similar treatment to jane eyre, another book i cringe at the thought of but that i know has only been ruined by an awful awful teacher.    \n",

metamorphosis. upon re-read, it's not as awful as i thought it back then, but my thoughts on the story will always be coloured by how much i despised it in high school.trying my best to look at it objectively, i still don't think the metamorphosis is amazing. it hits upon some interesting notes, but it also gets hella weird regarding familial relationships. i'm glad i gave this story another shot, but it's still certainly not a favourite.   \n",

dystopian novel of a theocratic government in what was formerly the united states of america is a reflection of fierce feminism shared by the most outspoken women of the time protesting the sexual exploitation and domination of women by men, particularly through the pornographic industry.\"the handmaid's tale\" illustrates the position of andrea dworkin, katherine mackinnon,dianna russell, and others that the sexual exploitation of women through pornography or prostitution serves as causation for violence against women.the sex positive feminist of today might well read \"the handmaid's tale\" in a different light than when it was published in 1986. candida royalle and tristan taormino, among others, most likely would have the attitude, \"it can't happen here.\"atwood's novel, told by offred, remains a compelling story of male domination of women. the subjugation of women through the use of a theocratic form of government remains within the realm of possibility. consider the warnings of muslim clerics this week that women being allowed to drive in saudi arabia would result in the decline or disappearance of virginity.in atwood's tale, a right wing fundamentalist group, the sons of jacob, take over the american government following a staged islamic attack on washington, d.c., in an event that becomes known as the massacre of the president. america becomes known as \"gilead,\" meaning \"hill of justice,\" or \"mound of witness.\"caught in an endless war reminiscent of that in \"1984,\" gilead begins to experience more serious problems that will affect its very existence. more and more women are becoming sterile, or, not that the men will admit it, somethings gone seriously wrong with sperm count.women who have shown themselves capable of producing children are imprisoned and given the term handmaids. their children are adopted by couples in positions of authority. handmaids are assigned to gilead officials for the purpose of procreating the species. these potential mothers are robbed of their identity and known by the patronymic of the official to whom they are assigned.\"tht\" is especially riveting in that it is told in the present tense in the first person by one handmaid assigned to the commandant fred. hence, we know her only as \"offred.\" the use of tense and voice lend to the tension of the plot as this technique leaves the outcome completely unknown.offred gives us only the slightest glimpse of her personal appearance. she stands 5'7\", she tells us, as she catches a glimpse of herself in a mirror.once a month, offred participates in a ritual, lying back against the body of the commandant's wife, serena joy, a former televangelist, as fred attempts to impregnate her. offred's perception is that she is not the victim of rape as she has consented to perform this duty. the fact that had she failed to fulfill this role would have resulted in her being placed in a house of prostitution, or even worse, banishment to the colonies, for burial of the war dead or clearing of toxic waste does not seem to dawn on her.however, fred is not content to leave his relationship at a monthly ritual. he has offred sent to his library where he asks her to play a game of scrabble with him. such fraternization is prohibited. nor are women allowed reading material.initially, the commandant presents as a somewhat poignant figure, desiring the companionship of a woman with a mind. more so, the commandant appears to miss the idea of intimate companionship. however, fred loses any appearance worthy of sympathy when he smuggles offred into a brothel, passing her off as a woman hired for the night. even within the most strict theocracy the forbidden fruit is the most sweet.offred's flashbacks to the time before are particularly heartbreaking. she was married, in love, and a mother of a five year old girl. the coming of gilead's dictatorship is evident. offred, her husband luke, and their child attempt to escape by taking a supposed picnic. the outcome is inevitable. offred loses her husband, her child, and herself.offred's relationship with her mother is particularly interesting. her mother was a classic feminist of the 1970s. this was a time that \"our bodies ourselves\" was practically required reading in college women's studies classes. her mother was a participant at the first \"take back the night\" observances. it should be noted that take back the night was originally associated with the feminist anti-pornography movement, before it became more widely associated with sexual assault prevention.offred was actually embarrassed by her mother's outspoken nature. she would have preferred her mother to be more like her contemporaries' mothers. one wonders how she felt about her mother's attitudes after the societal controls of gilead were in place.against offred's self-portrait, offred presents her stronger, rebellious friend moira. moira was never one to follow convention, even in the freer days of pre-gilead america. moira's actions after the theocratic takeover are in direct opposition to offred's. moira attempts escape, defies authority, and remains resistant emotionally, though she complies outwardly with the demands made of her. nevertheless, she is still free in comparison to offred.offred's compliance with authority at times is frustrating. the reader may lose patience with her lack of resistance. yet, she is in a different situation than moira. she does have a child. perhaps it is the dimmest hope that she might one day be reunited with that child that accounts for her lack of active resistance.but the severity of gilead's dealing with failure to comply must also be factored in to offred's inaction. those deemed unacceptable to the policies of gilead are salvaged, that is, executed. their bodies are hung on hooks on display as a constant reminder of the consequences for disobedience.as should be expected, for every dictatorship, there is an active resistance. it is through this resistance that offred eventually achieves her escape.the ultimate downfall of gilead is not revealed by atwood. however, we know that it occurs. we also know that offred's tale is discovered and told. in the ultimate denouement of tht, the authenticity of offred's tale is debated at an anthropological conference. a male scholar lectures that a fellow scholar had dubbed the story the handmaid's tale after the fashion of chaucer's canterbury tales. at one point the lecturer refers to offred's story as the question of the handmaid's \"tail.\" atwood offers no solace that gender equality will ever be achieved.while one may question offred's courage, i suggest that enduring the unbearable to ultimately serve as a witness to evil is a form of courage in and of itself. to borrow a bit from faulkner, offred not only endured, she prevailed. ultimately atwood's message to each of us is that we have a choice to accept gender bias, or attempt to stop it. offred inspires me to stop it.</td>\n",

       "      <td>4/5 stars“the best books... are those that tell you what you know already.”it's 2019, and that quote is more true than it's ever been. it's truly terrifying to read a book in which some things are so real, that for a moment you don't know which reality is yours. sure, our food isn't rationed and we have enough razors for shaving, but the collective mindset is very much the same. if only orwell knew how prophetic his book turned out to be. he meant it as a warning, but it tuned out to be more of a manual. the idea of newspeak is especially funny to me, because although it isn't called that - english language nowadays is definitely at a stage that is more slang than an actual language. and it's only getting worse with years. i mean if we already add words such as \"selfie\" \"derp\" and most embarrassingly \"twerk\" into the oxford dictionary, what is next? no, no, don't tell me, it's too horrible even to imagine. “but if thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought.”with the social media being the monster it currently is, we long forgotten any right or even need for privacy. people catalog everything about themselves on the web - engagements, weddings, births, divorces. nothing is secret, nothing is sacred anymore. and the worst part? we enjoy doing it. we enjoy sharing. we tell ourselves we share, so our relatives in other states, or countries, can see it, but in reality we all pine for likes. for some stranger to adore our lives, to think that we have it so good. “power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing.”​i never had to read 1984 in high school, i didn't grow up in the united states, but i know many of you did. i am surprised that this book was only only allowed, but required for reading. this book is a mirror for many current political and economical tactics and machinations. but maybe we are too comfortable to listen. maybe the horrible things that happened to winston are too bizarre for our pampered and spoiled minds? if not for the many info-dumps, this book unfortunately (writing wise) subjects the reader to, i'd have given it 5 stars. 1984 is brilliant. scary so. it also doesn't read like a classic. for being written in 1949, it's very modern (albeit boring at times) in its language and execution of ideas on paper. having never read this book before, i didn't know what to expect from the plot, but there was no happy ending. and if we aren't careful, we might end up just like winston, drinking bad alcohol, starting mutely at a tv screen and believing everything the \"big brother\" tells us. “being in a minority, even in a minority of one, did not make you mad. there was truth and there was untruth, and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world, you were not mad.”my websitemy instagrammy wordpress blog</td>\n",

       "      <td>how does one review a book like this? certainly there is nothing i can add to what others in the past nearly 70 years have already written about this classic american novel. i read the book because it is one \"those books\" which i should have read a long time ago but never did. it belongs in a category of books i am embarrassed to say i never got around to reading and should have. well now i have and i have to say i am rather disappointed. as i reflect on this feeling i realize it is unfair. it is a good book and definitely worth the time to read but i guess i'd have to say it hasn't aged well. when it published in 1953 the cold war was at its height, mccarthyism was raging, stalin had died but the extent of his evil was first coming to light. the timelines of fahrenheit 451 was clearly going to make it a book that would resonate with a public desperately trying to cope with a new and frightening world. i can easily see how this book would claim a deserved place in modern american literature. however, that was 1953 and this is 2019 and the book and its story are known to most if not all literate people. reading the book now, therefore, doesn't come with any surprises or revelations as the story is too well known. it can be appreciated for the author's artfulness and imagination but the images he created no longer carry the same impact they might have had in decades past. if there was anything that did impress me it was his imagining of wall sized televisions and people mesmerized by their television shows and the resulting loss of human interaction that results from the attachments to these electronic devices. i wish he were still alive to deal with this issue as it exists today. sadly, he is gone but at least he left us with this book. this is a work of serious significance in literature that while a bit dated still has some worth to the contemporary reader.</td>\n",

       "      <td>a dark, enlightening, addictive dystopia“it was a pleasure to burn.”in ray bradbury’s 1953 dystopian classic, “fahrenheit 451,” guy montag is a “fireman” tasked with tracking down books and burning them, typically by incinerating the “perpetrator’s” dwelling as well. encounters with the free-thinking teenager clarisse mcclellan are what begin to rip away his view of the world. until she mysteriously disappears.“the girl? she was a time bomb. the family had been feeding her subconscious, i’m sure, from what i saw of her school record. she didn’t want to know how a thing was done, but why. that can be embarrassing. you ask why to a lot of things and you wind up very unhappy indeed, if you kept at it. the poor girl’s better off dead.”meanwhile, montag’s wife and her friends are obsessed with their “family” in the “telescreen,” what would be equivalent today to america’s obsession with reality tv. after an elderly woman allows herself to burn with her home (and her books), and with clarisse gone, mildred out of touch, montag turns to a former english professor named faber to rationalize his life. the idea expressed is that books are a collection of human thought, which can be dangerous.“do you know why books such as this are so important? because they have quality. and what does the word quality mean? to me it means texture. this book has pores. it has features. this book can go under the microscope. you’d find life under the glass, streaming past in infinite profusion…the good writers touch life often. the mediocre ones run a quick hand over her. the bad ones rape her and leave her for the flies.”faber and montag concoct a plan to take down the firemen until their world comes crashing down, and montag is forced to run for his life.the bleak denouement mr. bradbury depicts has not (yet) come to pass. interestingly, it’s the underlying theme of the erosion of creativity and intelligence, especially as it relates to america’s obsession with tv, which seems more prescient. for instance, according to nielsen, americans over the age of 2 spend an average of 34 hours/week watching live tv and another 6 hours/week watching taped tv, while usa today reports that 1 in 7 american adults cannot understand their fuel bill, much less a news article, or, unfortunately, wonderful metaphors like this:“it doesn’t matter what you do, he said, so long as you change something from the way it was before you touched it into something that’s like you after you take your hands away. the difference between the man who just cuts lawns and a real gardener is in the touching, he said. the lawn-cutter might just as well not have been there at all; the gardener will be there a lifetime.”the bottom line: explore. ask why. discover new and enlightening ideas. challenge conventional views and make a difference. these, among so many more, are the messages of mr. bradbury’s masterpiece, a must read for fans of dystopian fiction.</td>\n",

(if i didn't that'd be an unnecessarily specific sentiment, right?) do i expect to laugh? uh... do i expect to evil cackle at the satire or at the extreme second-hand embarrassment? what...what kinds of classics would you be reading here, meredith?? well, dear reader (wrong book, mer), i would be reading pride and prejudice. (obviously.)i am a slow, slow reader. you'd think reading often i'd get quicker at it, but i've accepted my fate now. point is, i listened to the audiobook available on youtube as i read and not only did it help pace me quicker, it made it so much more fun. the british accents were amazing, and hearing the snarky satire read aloud felt like exactly how austen intended it because her dialogue is so much fun! just fun! i had a genuinely fun time with this! with this, a classic!! anyways, i don't feel qualified to be like hey, austen, you're a good writer. because of course she is? and who am i to compliment this queen? but, yea, the dialogue made the gossip and the scandal and utter cringe that is mr. collins so accessible and just a plain good time. did i mention this was fun?not only was the dialogue a highlight, but the times austen pops in to lowkey roast her own characters are fantastic.(“the strangeness of mr. collins’s making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted”....also...“they were ignorant, idle, and vain. while there was an officer in meryton, they would flirt with him; and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn, they would be going there forever”) i wouldn't call her satire super subtle, but i do think it's unexpected. here's a woman in the 18th or 19th century writing a romance novel, and it's nothing at all what the current times would suggest it to be. it's a powerful female lead (lizzy you icon you) who rejects multiple men (multiple times) and gives us quotes like this: “what are men to rocks and mountains?” i just..i respect that.so jane austen can write satire and i love that she uses that to further empower her female characters. and i love that she herself pops in to roast every character. the fact that no character is immune to austen's satire keeps the reader on their feet. and yes, it makes it fun. i am well aware of the criticism austen received and continues to receive about the fact that her books are gossipy and i am vaguely certain that charlotte bronte thought they lacked substance. but i am not opposed to reading things that are fun. and i would never say something fun is worth less than something deeply sad. i like this one. i can only hope i have half the grit and strength elizabeth and jane austen herself had someday. ---------------------elizabeth and darcy are the power couple i never knew i needed. lizzy telling off lady catherine? amazing. mr. bennet writing a passive aggressive note to mr. collins? iconic! i'm excited to check out more by jane austen!review to come!</td>\n",

       "      <td>\\n\\nbook review\\n\\n4 out of 5 stars to the metamorphosis, written in 1915 by franz kafka. i think most people are familiar with the premise of this book, and rather than do a normal review, i thought maybe i'd question how on earth kafka came up with this one? it was such a great way to tell the story and teach a lesson... a man wakes up as a giant beetle? (i secretly suspect he came across a huge cockroach in his apartment while in nyc one day). and how do you deal with such a change? your family is afraid. they are embarrassed. you can talk. what's really going on here? what is kafka trying to say about life? we're all insensitive? liars? fakes? humorists? nutty? so many things to read into here... it's a run book, too. when you're a bug life's quite different. have you ever managed something like that before? no. so how did kafka come up with all the little things to make it real? i'm glad he did as this book helps you enjoy reading when you may be forced to read some classics at a younger age that don't appeal to you. as an more mature reader, you find all the symbols and beauty in the messages with this one. i believe i read it twice, possibly some excerpts for a third instance. each time, it gets better. i would love to see a really good film or tv adaption... purely to witness the metaphorical views a director would incorporate on the big screen or the stage. the words are amazing, but it's what you experience by reading it that makes it such a wonderful book.\\n\\nabout me\\n\\nfor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: i read a lot. i write a lot. and now i blog a lot. first the book review goes on goodreads, and then i send it on over to my wordpress blog at https://thisismytruthnow.com, where you'll also find tv &amp; film reviews, the revealing and introspective 365 daily challenge and lots of blogging about places i've visited all over the world. and you can find all my social media profiles to get the details on the who/what/when/where and my pictures. leave a comment and let me know what you think. vote in the poll and ratings. thanks for stopping by.</td>\n",

       "      <td>the metamorphosis is an absurbist story about gregor samsa, a man who finds he has been transformed into a giant beetle during the night. no reason is given for gregor's metamorphosis, and he acts calm about the situation. gregor is such a good dependable traveling saleman that he only seems upset that he is going to be late for work. his supervisor from work is unsympathetic, and the business is portrayed as uncaring toward its employees. his family seems to worry more about the loss of income than for gregor's welfare. as the story progresses, gregor's emotions stay very human while his behavior becomes more and more like an insect. gregor is so emotionally conflicted that he loses his appetite for food.gregor's family is undergoing a metamorphosis as much as he is. although his sister tries to take care of him in the beginning, his family reaches the point where he is too much of a burden and they no longer value him. they are stressed, embarrassed, and financially struggling. kafka seems to be pointing out how family dynamics change, and how society isolates people with physical and mental problems. the family members change from being very dependent on gregor to becoming more self-sufficient. their metamorphosis is complete at the end as they look to the future.i really enjoyed this novella because it contained so much about human emotions as well as business, society, and family dynamics which often can be difficult and unhappy. life is sometimes unfair as it throws terrible challenges at good people. this would be interesting to read in a classroom setting to hear other people's ideas about the book. the cute \"google doodle\" on july 3, 2013 showed a big upright beetle or cockroach coming through the door with a traveling salesman's suitcase in honor of kafka's 130th birthday. that gave me the extra push to finally get around to reading this classic.</td>\n",

       "      <td>this is another \"classic\" book that i'm glad i didn't try reading in high school. in this case it's my opinion that brave new world should be included as a classic, unlike some other classics i've read. this book sent me through a wide range of emotions, ultimately with the end leaving me thinking \"whoa, what just happened?\" i was a little embarrassed to have to search the internet for \"what happened at the end of brave new world\" after i finished reading the book, but thankfully it looks like many other people didn't really get it either. i guess i understood what happened, but i didn't really understand the meaning of it. i've searched for quite a while for anything that huxley may have said about the book but there's not much out there on the subject. the main thing i found is that huxley originally started writing the book as a parody to poke fun at some of his contemporaries such as h.g. wells. there are some clear themes throughout the book, but i guess it's up to the reader to decide what he thinks the whole point of it is.brave new world is a quite disturbing view of the future where there is no such thing as families, mothers (\"mother\" is a taboo word in their society), fathers, sadness, and meaning in life. instead of being born, children are created in factories and conditioned for their future lives as alphas, betas, deltas, gammas, and epsilons. alphas and betas are the ruling class while the other three classes are the worker bees, servants, etc. but it's ok that they are sorted into classes because, due to their childhood conditioning, they are all happy with the group they belong to and wouldn't rather do anything else besides the job they were meant to have. promiscuous sex is encouraged, in fact it is disgusting and extremely inappropriate for people to pair off. everyone is provided rations of soma, a drug that fogs the mind and creates feelings of happiness and enjoyment. citizens use soma whenever they start to have any sort of negative emotion or feeling. at work the people are conditioned to behave as adults, but outside of work they are to act as children. there are innumerable entertainment options provided for the people to enjoy such as electromagnetic golf and \"feelies\" (basically movies with sensations, smells, etc.). there are no diseases, people are kept looking young for their entire lives, and then when it's time to die they live at death centers and no one is sad. there isn't really anyone to feel sad for them anyway since no one has families and they don't really have close friends either.long story shorter a couple of the main characters named bernard and lenina visit a \"savage reservation\" which is essentially a zoo where native americans are allowed to live the old way and the people in the brave new world can come visit and study them. bernard and lenina bring back a boy named john whose mother originally came from the brave new world. we read about john's perspective of the brave new world compared to his \"savage\" upbringing. john eventually has a pretty amazing conversation with the world's head \"controller\" which i'll provide some quotes from below. i won't spoil the ending here but it was intense and quite abrupt. of course since this is a dystopian book there were some elements of the future world that huxley describes that are very unbelievable but there were also some things he described that seem extremely prescient since he wrote this in 1931.some other highlights:- bernard sometimes doubts the merits of the society, seems like he could end up being the hero- helmholtz finds it difficult to be a writer when there's not much to write about- the people constantly repeating the conditioning phrases they heard hundreds of thousands of times as children in the conditioning centershere are some interesting quotes from the book:\"'but, bernard, you're saying the most awful things.' 'don't you wish you were free, lenina?' 'i don't know what you mean. i am free. free to have the most wonderful time. everybody's happy nowadays.' he laughed, 'yes, everybody's happy nowadays. we begin giving children that at five. but wouldn't you like to be free to be happy in some other way, lenina? in your own way, for example; not in everybody else's way.'\"\"'that'll teach him,' he said to himself. but he was mistaken. for bernard left the room with a swagger, exulting, as he banged the door behind him, in the thought that he stood alone, embattled against the order of things; elated by the intoxicating consciousness of his individual significance and importance.\"\"\"ladies and gentlemen,\" the director repeated once more, \"excuse me for thus interrupting your labours. a painful duty constrains me. the security and stability of society are in danger. yes, in danger, ladies and gentlemen. this man,\" he pointed accusingly at bernard, \"this man who stands before you here, this alpha-plus to whom so much has been given, and from whom, in consequence, so much must be expected, this colleague of yours–or should i anticipate and say this ex-colleague?–has grossly betrayed the trust imposed in him. by his heretical views on sport and soma, by the scandalous unorthodoxy of his sex-life, by his refusal to obey the teachings of our ford and behave out of office hours, 'even as a little infant,'\" (here the director made the sign of the t), \"he has proved himself an enemy of society, a subverter, ladies and gentlemen, of all order and stability, a conspirator against civilization itself. for this reason i propose to dismiss him, to dismiss him with ignominy from the post he has held in this centre; i propose forthwith to apply for his transference to a subcentre of the lowest order and, that his punishment may serve the best interest of society, as far as possible removed from any important centre of population.\" \"'do they read shakespeare?' asked the savage as they walked, on their way to the bio-chemical laboratories, past the school library.'certainly not,' said the head mistress, blushing. 'our library,' said dr. gaffney, 'contains only books of reference. if our young people need distraction, they can get it at the feelies. we don't encourage them to indulge in any solitary amusements.'\"\"a new theory of biology\" was the title of the paper which mustapha mond had just finished reading. he sat for some time, meditatively frowning, then picked up his pen and wrote across the title-page: \"the author's mathematical treatment of the conception of purpose is novel and highly ingenious, but heretical and, so far as the present social order is concerned, dangerous and potentially subversive. not to be published.\" he underlined the words. \"the author will be kept under supervision. his transference to the marine biological station of st. helena may become necessary.\" a pity, he thought, as he signed his name. it was a masterly piece of work. but once you began admitting explanations in terms of purpose–well, you didn't know what the result might be. it was the sort of idea that might easily decondition the more unsettled minds among the higher castes–make them lose their faith in happiness as the sovereign good and take to believing, instead, that the goal was somewhere beyond, somewhere outside the present human sphere, that the purpose of life was not the maintenance of well-being, but some intensification and refining of consciousness, some enlargement of knowledge. which was, the controller reflected, quite possibly true. but not, in the present circumstance, admissible. he picked up his pen again, and under the words \"not to be published\" drew a second line, thicker and blacker than the first; then sighed, \"what fun it would be,\" he thought, \"if one didn't have to think about happiness!\" \"a v.p.s. treatment indeed! she would have laughed, if she hadn't been on the point of crying. as though she hadn't got enough v. p. of her own! she sighed profoundly as she refilled her syringe. 'john,' she murmured to herself, 'john …' then 'my ford,' she wondered, 'have i given this one its sleeping sickness injection, or haven't i?' she simply couldn't remember. in the end, she decided not to run the risk of letting it have a second dose, and moved down the line to the next bottle. twenty-two years, eight months, and four days from that moment, a promising young alpha-minus administrator at mwanza-mwanza was to die of trypanosomiasis–the first case for over half a century. sighing, lenina went on with her work.\"mustapha mond smiled. \"well, you can call it an experiment in rebottling if you like. it began in a.f. 473. the controllers had the island of cyprus cleared of all its existing inhabitants and re-colonized with a specially prepared batch of twenty-two thousand alphas. all agricultural and industrial equipment was handed over to them and they were left to manage their own affairs. the result exactly fulfilled all the theoretical predictions. the land wasn't properly worked; there were strikes in all the factories; the laws were set at naught, orders disobeyed; all the people detailed for a spell of low-grade work were perpetually intriguing for high-grade jobs, and all the people with high-grade jobs were counter-intriguing at all costs to stay where they were. within six years they were having a first-class civil war. when nineteen out of the twenty-two thousand had been killed, the survivors unanimously petitioned the world controllers to resume the government of the island. which they did. and that was the end of the only society of alphas that the world has ever seen.\"\"awful? they don't find it so. on the contrary, they like it. it's light, it's childishly simple. no strain on the mind or the muscles. seven and a half hours of mild, unexhausting labour, and then the soma ration and games and unrestricted copulation and the feelies. what more can they ask for? true,\" he added, \"they might ask for shorter hours. and of course we could give them shorter hours. technically, it would be perfectly simple to r...</td>\n",

       "      <td>last tuesday, i started from home early since it is typically a 2-hour train journey to get to the city library. on the way, i watched all the frolic panic among the people hurrying to their workplace. eating their breakfast on the train, making up their hairs, and a bunch of other people trying to find space in the crowded footboard. i wondered why people go further anyway. i felt guilty not being among them continuing the cycle of whatever this is and call it a meaningful existence. it worried me a bit myself standing in between the conventional spectator and curious inquisitor of values and social constructs especially why something has more values than others. basically, it's all up to us deciding which has more value. power resides where people believe it resides for we are the beings under the influence of it since the known past. this existential philosophy scared me a bit that if existence precedes the essence, as said by sartre, the literal meaning of life is anything that we choose to be. it wouldn't favor much except for the personal whim and fancies of subjective experience. my thoughts couldn't help anymore but somehow i convinced myself that i'd become normal once after reaching the library and completing this book of camus. this habitual convincing and despair has been repeating in a while for the past couple years. maybe i'm in the cycle of absurdities on this phase of my life but some part of me doesn't want to believe it as it didn't mean anything while the other parts find it a great secret and a great comfort for finding reasons to exist even if it is for a moment.i found a translation of penguin hardcover edition, headed straight to the couch to get started. and it started \"mother died today. or yesterday maybe, i don't know\", it's a nice way to start a novel. mersault was more like a modern-day buddhist having his own values, self-awareness of being in the present and unconventional perceptions that makes him look aloof by the readers from the very starting. he didn't cry for the death of his mother because he thought it's quite natural for someone to die at some point of life.\"when it comes down to life, i wasn't aware of the fact that it doesn't matter much whether you die at 30 or 75\"it took me a while understanding that there are only facts or events without any explanation so that the readers are unconsciously forced back to reflect on their own life to look for interpretations for the actions of mersault the protagonist. but it wasn't the case for me for i've read the myth of sisyphus which share the pretty much same questioning and inquiring of values but with tedious explanations and thought process of multifarious complexity, and his other short essay on the capital punishment for the second part of the novel where mersault happen to kill an arab and set to face the trial. the narration might give a culmination of satirical, indifferent take on certain values based on family, law(not justice) and other presumed existential certainties that society took for absolute. \"he seemed so certain of everything, didn't he? and yet none of his certainties was worth one hair of woman's head.\"as author elucidated in the afterword, mersault was condemned because he didn't play the game under the rules of the society for he was the outsider. i never understood since the day i read somewhere camus told that he wasn't an existentialist philosopher and very different from the contemporaries like jean-paul satre. this book is exactly an anti-existentialist work and also one of the classic existentialist works of the twentieth century. the point is that absurdity is divine. the only way to be in agreement with life is to disagree with ourselves.it ends up something like this, “and i, too, felt ready to start life all over again. it was as if that great rush of anger had washed me clean, emptied me of hope, and, gazing up at the dark sky spangled with its signs and stars, for the first time, the first, i laid my heart open to the benign indifference of the universe. to feel it so like myself, indeed, so brotherly, made me realize that i’d been happy, and that i was happy still.”, at the point where he was ready to accept the death rather \"getting free\" by submitting to the providence. i couldn't figure out the working but i somehow started sobbing inside the library without realizing my presence. some people made sure i was okay. i started leaving the library then, to avoid further embarrassment, that the intensity of the suffering was no less diminished, i looked down the busy road with honking bikes and smoking cars, indistinct chattering and the heat waves blew over tried vainly to rip apart the silence of my cold damn numbed mind. maybe i should get used to this indifference. it didn't make much sense but i found comfort and suffering walking through the shoes of mersault.\"a life in which each man's destiny is merely to age and die; the feeling that, at time, one is a stranger not merely for others but to oneself\"basically what camus did his entire life was encourage people to lose themselves in finding harmony and confusion in nothingness and in the concept of absurdism, then finding themselves revolting against it, and then eventually finding the others exercising some control over the values and morals. at least, we could say he had a meaningful existence but it’s quite natural to say it doesn’t mean anything.</td>\n",

       "      <td>do scientists and doctors have the right to tamper with a person’s brain power?in a return to the classics, here’s an excellent science fiction novel that looks at this important ethical question. the story is about charlie gordon, a thirty-two-year-old man with a low iq. committed to a state home as a teenager, now he is out. he’s living in a rooming house and working at a bakery in new york, all through the help of a family friend. he is happy, has friends at work and friends at his school, where he has worked hard to learn how to read and write.because of charlie’s impressive motivation, professor nemur and dr. strauss from beekman university determine he is an excellent candidate for an experimental procedure to increase intelligence, one that has only been performed on mice. algernon is their superstar mouse that has learned how to navigate through complicated mazes. now nemur and strauss want to take it to the next level.charlie is willing. “after the operashun im gonna try to be smart. im gonna try awful hard,” he writes.the surgery is a seeming success and charlie’s intelligence increases, at first slowly, but later at a fantastic rate. soon he is reading voraciously and learning ancient languages, complex theories, sciences, history, economics and classic literature and eventually surpassing nemur and strauss. but charlie’s emotional intelligence is woefully behind and he doesn’t know what to do with the many new strong and complex feelings he experiences.through memory recall, charlie begins to understand that the people in his life had been cruel to him, with their hurtful jokes and abuse, and that he had played a part in their jokes. “that hurts most of all,” he writes.in addition, memories of his mother’s shame and embarrassment and her ultimate rejection make charlie’s new knowledge painful. even nemur and strauss treat him as an experiment and not as a human, forgetting that he was already a person with feelings before the surgery.at his intellectual peak, charlie detects a flaw in the theory and foresees his decline. how will it end as algernon runs through his maze and charlie navigates his own complicated path? with limited time, charlie will try to figure it out. he writes, “i see now that the path i choose through that maze makes me what i am.”flowers for algernon began as a short story in 1959. in 1960, it won the hugo award for best short story. the novel was published in 1966 and was the joint winner of the nebula award for best novel. no surprise that both forms won awards. despite being an older story, flowers for algernon raises important points about human feelings and the ethics of scientific experimentation.</td>\n",

       "      <td>i first came across flowers for algernon as a short story in a science fiction anthology many years ago. it seemed an enjoyably poignant and perceptive slight tale. by 1966 the author daniel keyes had developed his story into this full length novel, the joint winner of the year's nebula award for the best science fiction novel. it was the high point of daniel keyes’s career. as well as nonfiction he has written several other science fiction books which explore the workings of the mind. but the classic flowers for algernon has sold more than five million copies, and has never been out of print since its original publication. daniel keyes's science fiction stories were intermittently published during the 1950s, before he became a fiction editor at marvel science fiction. he also worked as a high school teacher for developmentally disabled adults. these two experiences resulted in the masterpiece, flowers for algernon. daniel keyes said that the idea for the story struck him while he waited for an elevated train to take him from brooklyn to new york university in 1945. in his 1999 memoir, he wrote,\"i thought: my education is driving a wedge between me and the people i love. and then i wondered: 'what would happen if it were possible to increase a person's intelligence?'\"the best speculative stories start from a simple idea: \"what if?\" this is such a story. it has no need for alien worlds, galactic swashbucklers, bug-eyed monsters or complicated spaceship technology. this is not the world of hard sci fi, focusing on science and the inhuman aspects of other worlds. like all classic science fiction, it seems to transcend the limitations of the genre. it explores universal human themes such as the nature of intelligence, the nature of emotion, and how the two interact with each other. even the intelligence-enhancing surgery is not detailed, except for brief mentions of the workings of the brain, and the rare genetic condition phenylketonuria, to add authenticity to the enhanced intellectual capabilities of the narrator. the story is told from the point of view of a thirty-two-year-old man, who has been assessed as having an iq of 68. the narrator, charlie gordon, works at donner’s bakery in new york city as a janitor and delivery boy. he writes that he,\"reely wantd to lern i wantid it more even then pepul who are smarter even then me … all my life i wantid to be smart and not dumb\".his teacher alice kinnian, who works at the \"beekman college centre for retarded adults\", recognises his strong motivation and desire to learn. she has put him forward as a potential candidate to undergo experimental surgery designed to boost his intelligence.a team of university researchers have already performed the experiment successfully on the lab mouse algernon. charlie has a number of tests, including a comparison with algernon to indicate how quickly he can solve a maze. this part of the book sets the tone for the gentle humour which is to follow. charlie reports the tests with perfect childlike clarity and literal incomprehension. he has no imagination; no ability to invent. the directors of the experiment, dr. strauss and professor nemur, agree that charlie is a good choice, and ask charlie to keep a journal, “dr strauss says i shoud rite down what i think and remembir and evrey thing that happins to me from now on.”the entire narrative of flowers for algernon is composed of this series of “progress reports” which charlie writes in his diary. charlie is excited and optimistic, despite the scientists' caution,\"you know charlie we are not shure how this experamint will werk on pepul because we only tried it up to now on animils.\" at this point the reader realises that not only we will be able to anticipate charlie's progress by watching algernon's burgeoning intelligence, but we will be able to deduce it by the content and linguistic competence of charlie's journal. it is a brilliantly inspired device on the part of daniel keyes. charlie's teacher alice continues to help him improve his spelling and grammar, and he determinedly reads adult books, filling his brain with knowledge from a wide range of academic fields. his progress is slow at first, but his comprehension accelerates as he devours his reading, delighting in his new-found knowledge and understanding,\"this is beauty, love, and truth all rolled into one. this is joy.\"the story follows both the events in the laboratory, and events in charlie's personal life. it becomes clear that the owner of the bakery is being kind to charlie in keeping him in work, and that it has really been an act of charity. his co-workers however frequently make fun of and mock him. charlie, on the other hand, has always viewed them as his true friends. the realisation that what he thought of as shared jokes are taunts, and that he is a laughing stock, is very hurtful to him. we feel his pain through his faithful record, \"i never knew before that joe and frank and the others liked to have me around just to make fun of me. now i know what they mean when they say 'to pull a charlie gordon'. i'm ashamed.\"as he begins to realise the truth of the psychiatrist dr. strauss's observation,\"the more intelligent you get the more problems you'll have charlie.\"charlie continues to work hard at the bakery, (view spoiler)[even inventing a process to improve productivity. but the surgery on him is a secret. and because his emotional development cannot keep pace with his astonishing mental feats, he does not realise that he is now alienated from the other workers, frank and joe, and gimpy, the head baker, who has a club foot. they cannot understand the changes and are disturbed by the sudden change in him. they begin to fear him. charlie on the other hand is learning all the time and pleased at his new challenges in interacting with other people. one event produces a moral dilemma, which he attempts to solve, but which eventually leads to him losing his job. (hide spoiler)] \"before, they had laughed at me, despising me for my ignorance and dullness; now, they hated me for my knowledge and understanding.\"perplexed, charlie approaches the scientists to help him, and the advice from each reflects their differing world views. alice recognises that he needs to develop and experience moral quandries for himself, and tells him to trust his heart. this is an everyday moral dilemma, but one which has no easy or right answer.\"what's right? ironic that all my intelligence doesn't help me solve a problem like this.\"there are many layers to charlie gordon. as he develops, his personality changes. thrilled at first to learn, he begins to be alternately angry and embarrassed when he remembers what he sees as his earlier foolish self. he also begins to remember his early childhood, and we learn all about his parents, rose and matt gordon.(view spoiler)[ his father had been a barber's shop supply salesman, who hated both his job and his life. his mother's overriding concern was to \"be smart\" and keep up appearances. charlie remembers that he had a sister, who was considered to be a replacement for him, and named norma because it sounded like “normal.” these sections where he gradually recovers lost memories of his childhood are very moving. as charlie and the reader learns more, we begin to realise that charlie's childhood was not the happy dream that he had envisaged. (hide spoiler)] all the flashbacks are interspersed with the narrative, so that the stories of charlie’s present and past intertwine and reflect upon each other, adding to both charlie's and the reader's understanding of the current situation.as his brain becomes more incisive, charlie learns sarcasm, suspicion, and resentment. his faith in the people around him begins to crumble, \"now i understand that one of the reasons for going to college and getting an education is to learn that the things you've believed in all your life aren't true, and that nothing is what it appears to be.\"\"i'm confused. i don't know what i know any more.\"(view spoiler)[the one person he trusts is alice, but whenever charlie contemplates becoming intimate, he feels as if the old charlie is watching him. distracted, he panics and his mind dissociates. charlie is confused about the origin of this, but the reader understands that it is a deep-seated memory of rose punishing and beating him for any slight sexual impulses, resulting in the shame he still feels. (hide spoiler)] charlie's feeling of his \"other self\" becomes stronger as the novel proceeds, continually resurfacing at crucial points, in the form of the old charlie, perceived as a separate entity existing outside of himself. in this and other ways, the past persists in the present. for instance, he remembers long ago watching through a window in his apartment, as other children played. later, with his enhanced intelligence, he feels as if the old charlie is watching him through a window. the window seems to represent an emotional distance: a barrier to normal society, which the mentally disabled charlie cannot cross. later, he is just as distanced from his former self as the children he used to watch playing had been. once he sees the other charlie face-to-face in a mirror, a glimpse of his other self: a very frightening experience.delighted with charlie's progress, dr. strauss and professor nemur take both charlie and algernon to a scientific convention in chicago. but charlie has reservations, \"how different they seem now. and how foolish i was ever to have thought that professors were intellectual giants. they're people - and afraid the rest of the world will find out.\"\"i'm not an inanimate object ... i'm a person ... i was a person before the operation. in case you forgot.\" dr. strauss has always been concerned with his psychological health, but charlie feels that nemur treats him like just another lab animal. it is transparently clear that charlie’s scientific knowledge has advanced beyond professor nemur’s.(view spoiler)[in d...</td>\n",

       "      <td>before seagulls with roiders' arms, dolly, and jeff goldblum arguing about dinosaurs, there was flowers for algernon to ask the question: has science gone too far? after algernon the mouse not only reached the cheese in variously arranged mazes faster than the other mice, but hasn’t for some time seemed about to spontaneously combust or collapse into a black hole, the go-ahead is given for charlie gordon, his i.q. at 60, to undergo surgery to maximize his intelligence. from page one, daniel keyes drops us into charlie’s head, through which we see the world via charlie’s progress reports recording his day-to-day events and thoughts. it would be nice if, from the outset, charlie had lived with a loving family. it would be nice if he brought home sweet-smelling bread and cakes he made with best friends who were also his co-workers. it would be nice if, at school, he met with someone pretty he could fall in love with. it would be nice if they all loved him just the way he was, of an intelligence society has agreed to be unworthy of further than a moment’s thought, and they all joined hands together and skipped merrily into the orange-golden sunset towards a happily-ever-after ending. it would be nice. but it would be wishful thinking, realized in some other book written in some other reality that probably no one would read because its niceness clashed with their expectations for plausibility, which keyes is only too happy to accommodate. 47 years later, 54 if you count the short story that preceded it, flowers for algernon’s impact doesn’t seem to have dissipated any. “hey, since the world’s not depressing enough, if i wanted a book that’d make me ugly-cry to beat claire danes, what would you recommend?” after scrolling past the usual green, zusak, mccarthy, orwell, and dostoyevsky shout-outs, marking a few names to check back on later, keyes’s mention would invariably rise up to the top to float alongside the rest, his book a tiny, unassuming thing. but the reason i picked flowers for algernon was more because it seemed a natural next-read after the curious incident of the dog in the night-time. marcelo in the real world and 600 hours of edward were noticeable blips on my radar, too, yet starting from the beginning felt like the thing to do. those two books are going to have to wait now¹ because keyes took my feelings and did a real number on them. my icy thoughts were feeble before the sheer earnestness and circumstances of charlie gordon: “i dont care so much about bee-ing famus. i just want to be smart like other pepul so i can have lots of frends who like me.” keyes pulls no punches, as that’s not even twenty pages into the book. it’s hard not to like charlie, that is, at least as he was in the beginning. by the halfway mark, the book almost soured me on his character when his increased intelligence made him as insufferable as everyone else in the book found him. to better illustrate the progression of my goodwill towards charlie, here’s a very rough graph i put together in paint (i’m no hans rosling, so have a heart): at the height of charlie’s intelligence, he was at his most unlikable. even when keeping his history in mind, i thought him, as one character² put it, “an arrogant, self-centered, antisocial bastard.” it couldn’t be helped. he didn’t make it easy, what with his condescension (“i've got to guard against the natural tendency to look down on them now that i have surpassed them…” [notwithstanding the fact that he’s a genius]), his jokes (“just goes to show that you can't have everything you want in one woman. one more argument for polygamy…”), his priorities (“i went home and made love to fay, but kept thinking of alice…” [stop stringing her along, dude]), and his stubbornness (“if you don't open the door, i'm going to break it down…” [forget her!]). near and in the ending, i came to like him again only because he regressed, which i realize is majorly screwed-up. when the book finished, i got to thinking, and then it hit me, the way keyes so deftly toyed with my emotions. charlie at his cleverest was unrelatable, but i wasn’t supposed to relate to him. i was acting exactly like charlie’s co-workers at the bakery when he showed them up, his doctors when he embarrassed them, and alice and fay when he confused them. like them, i didn’t understand charlie’s intelligence, so i was quick to feel exasperation, resentment, and even some hostility. all that he has experienced is justification enough for how he feels, and keyes’s writing is very neatly and subtly done to show that. that said, i do still wish humility were a giant tuna with which to knock some sense into him.considering its subject matter, and despite its length, flowers for algernon is no light read. it would make you think, and then leave you faintly dissatisfied with your conclusions. is it right for charlie’s doctors to fiddle around with that which is beyond their comprehension? an answer in the negative comes easily enough to us, but what if they knew what they were doing? it gets murky here. people are going to have opinions and heated words. take it from me: born with profound deafness and went on the operating table nine years later for a cochlear implant. at that age, i saw it all as fun and games, oblivious to the gravity of the situation. the early scenes of flowers for algernon, especially those leading up to charlie’s surgery and the recovery afterwards, felt oddly familiar. charlie took to anesthesia (“so i breethed deep and then i gess i was very tired becase i went to sleep…”) much better than i did (i was made to count backwards and then had to be held down three numbers later). there’s a scene where charlie, at a conference which he headlines, is being paraded out by his doctors in front of a curious audience of scientists. i shared charlie’s sense of unreality when he heard himself being referred to as if he were not even in the same room. before i was cleared to receive my implant, i had to be thoroughly assessed and evaluated. my memory here is spotty, so i had no idea the process was so exhaustive until, some years back, i uncovered papers of the doctor’s notes, test results, and evaluation papers packed away in forgotten boxes. from my speaking and language skills (with english being my second language, i knew almost none of it beyond the very basic words gleaned from the tom and jerry cartoons) to hearing ability, everything relevant was examined. “james presents with a bilateral severe to profound hearing loss… james gave 17 ‘preferred’ responses and 5 ‘acceptable’ responses…” it’s not a little bizarre to read about yourself observed so clinically. but rather than “delightful,” “social,” and “a pleasure to work with” (not to toot my own horn), charlie gets called “a feeble-minded shell [and] a burden on the society,” so our situations are unfortunately not quite so comparable. but going back to my original point, my handicap and charlie’s may be very different, yet there’s arguably no less controversy surrounding cochlear implants, which the deaf culture sees as a threat to their way of life³. “who's to say that my light is better than your darkness?” it seems so simple to make a snap judgment until you put yourself in their shoes.if simba’s shaking mufasa’s corpse, macaulay culkin’s happy encounter with a bee colony in my girl, every harry potter death, what lotso did to the toys at the garbage dump, and all of schindler’s list didn’t send my waterworks into overdrive, nothing else will. sadness is not totally lost on me, however, and flowers for algernon packs a mean punch or two that, even when expected, still caught me unawares. yet there are occasionally light-hearted moments to keep you from descending into complete despair: a scene where algernon gets a girlfriend charlie has to decide first to be “of sound health and good moral character” before green-lighting the match is a riot. there’s also a fair bit of philosophizing that narrowly avoids sounding annoying and the occasional surprise of great writing combined with chilling insight, particularly when the book gets into warren home school, a mental institution. keyes points out much in the world that is frustrating: questionable parenting, bullying, and the arrogance and wastefulness of the scientific community (“papers like these made me angry. money, time, and energy squandered on the detailed analysis of the trivial...” and “another case of men devoting their lives to studying more and more about less and less…”). but keyes keeps returning in the book to society’s treatment (or lack thereof), most of it unthinking, jealous, and cruel, of the mentally challenged. it’s flattering to think of ourselves now as wiser and more magnanimous towards anyone and everyone. that’s a dangerous position to take. despite our best efforts, prejudices linger, and the uphill battle to stomp them out completely doesn’t look to be leveling out any time soon. “she said for a person who god gave so little to you did more than a lot of people with brains they never even used.” our denials, no matter how loud, don’t change how there’s that hubris of man, big or small, obvious or dormant, residing in all of us. there’s something wrong with the picture if it’s those of sound mind who need more humanizing than those without, and so long as that remains true, flowers for algernon will be a classic. even if and when the opposite becomes reality, the book will still be invaluable, if not all the more so, for being so honest a cautionary tale.¹after the curious incident and now flowers for algernon, i am in dire need of puppies, rainbows, and laughter.²that one character may be just as much of a bastard, but he’s not that far off the mark.³the sound and fury documentary elaborates more on this issue.</td>\n",

the idea that he is somehow an 'innovator of fantasy'. he did add a number of techniques to the repertoire of epic fantasy writers, and these have been dutifully followed by his many imitators, but for the most part, these techniques are little more than bad habits.many have called tolkien by such epithets as 'the father of fantasy', but anyone who makes this claim simply does not know of the depth and history of the fantasy genre. for those who are familiar with the great and influential fantastical authors, from ovid and ariosto to eddison and dunsany to r.e. howard and fritz leiber, it is clear that, long before tolkien, fantasy was already a complex, well-established, and even a respected literary genre.eddison's work contains an invented world, a carefully-constructed (and well-researched) archaic language, a powerful and unearthly queen, and a central character who is conflicted and lost between the forces of nobility and darkness. poul anderson's \\nthe broken sword\\n, which came out the same year as the fellowship of the ring, has distant, haughty elves, deep-delving dwarves, a broken sword which must be reforged, an epic war between the armies of light and darkness, another central character trapped between those extremes, and an interweaving of christian and pagan worldviews.so, if these aspects are not unique to tolkien, then what does set him apart? though dunsany, eddison, and anderson all present worlds where light and dark come into conflict, they present these conflicts with a subtle and often ironic touch, recognizing that morality is a dangerous thing to present in absolutes. tolkien (or c.s. lewis), on the other hand, has no problem in depicting evil as evil, good as good, and the only place they meet is in the temptation of an honest heart, as in gollum's case--and even then, he is not like eddison's lord gro or anderson's scafloc, characters who live under an alternative view of the world, but instead fluctuates between the highs and lows of tolkien's dualistic morality.it is a dangerous message to make evil an external, irrational thing, to define it as 'the unknown that opposes us', because it invites the reader to overlay their own morality upon the world, which is precisely what most modern fantasy authors tend to do, following tolkien's example. whether it's goodkind's libertarianism or john norman's sex slave fetish, its very easy to simply create a magical allegory to make one side 'right' and the other side 'wrong', and you never have to develop a dramatic narrative that actually explores the soundness of those ideas. make the good guys dress in bright robes or silvery maile and the bad guys in black, spiky armor, and a lot of people will never notice that all the 'good guys' are white, upper class men, while all the 'bad guys' are 'brutish foreigners', and that both sides are killing each other and trying to rule their little corner of the world.in tolkien's case, his moral view was a very specific evocation of the ideal of 'merrie england', which is an attempt by certain stodgy old tories (like tolkien) to rewrite history so that the nobility were all good and righteous leaders, the farmers were all happy in their 'proper place' (working a simple patch of dirt), while both industrialized cultures and the 'primitives' who resided to the south and east were 'the enemy' bent on despoiling the 'natural beauty of england' (despite the fact that the isles had been flattened, deforested, and partitioned a thousand years before).though tom bombadil remains as a strangely incoherent reminder of the moral and social complexity of the fantasy tradition upon which tolkien draws, he did his best to scrub the rest clean, spending years of his life trying to fit catholic philosophy more wholly into his pagan adventure realm. but then, that's often how we think of tolkien: bent over his desk, spending long hours researching, note-taking, compiling, and playing with language. even those who admit that tolkien demonstrates certain racist, sexist, and classicist leanings (as, indeed, do many great authors) still praise the complexity of his 'world building'.and any student of the great epics, like the norse eddas, the bible, or the shahnameh can see what tolkien is trying to achieve with his worldbuilding: those books presented grand stories, but were also about depicting a vast world of philosophy, history, myth, geography, morality and culture. they were encyclopedic texts, intended to instruct their people on everything important in life, and they are extraordinarily valuable to students of anthropology and history, because even the smallest detail can reveal something about the world which the book describes.so, tolkien fills his books with troop movements, dull songs, lines of lineage, and references to his own made-up history, mythology, and language. he has numerous briefly-mentioned side characters and events because organic texts like the epics, which were formed slowly, over time and compiled from many sources often contained such digressions. he creates characters who have similar names--which is normally a stupid thing to do, as an author, because it is so confusing--but he’s trying to represent a hereditary tradition of prefixes and suffixes and shared names, which many great families of history had. so tolkien certainly had a purpose in what he did, but was it a purpose that served the story he was trying to tell?simply copying the form of reality is not what makes good art. art is meaningful--it is directed. it is not just a list of details--everything within is carefully chosen by the author to make up a good story. the addition of detail is not the same as adding depth, especially since tolkien’s world is not based on some outside system--it is whatever he says it is. it’s all arbitrary, which is why the only thing that grants a character, scene, or detail purpose is the meaning behind it. without that meaning, then what tolkien is doing is just a very elaborate thought exercise. now, it’s certainly true that many people have been fascinated with studying it, but that’s equally true of many thought exercises, such as the rules and background of the pokemon card game, or crossword puzzles.ostensibly, scrabble supposedly is a game for people who love words--and yet, top scrabble players sit an memorize lists of words whose meaning they will never learn. likewise, many literary fandom games become little more than word searches: find this reference, connect that name to this character--but which have no meaning or purpose outside of that. the point of literary criticism is always to lead us back to human thought and ideas, to looking at how we think and express ourselves. if a detail in a work cannot lead us back to ourselves, then it is no more than an arbitrary piece of chaff.the popularity of tolkien’s work made it acceptable for other authors to do the same thing, to the point that whenever i hear a book lauded for the ‘depth of its world building’, i expect to find a mess of obsessive detailing, of piling on so many inconsequential facts and figures that the characters and stories get buried under the scree, as if the author secretly hopes that by spending most of the chapter describing the hero’s cuirass, we'll forget that he’s a bland archetype who only succeeds through happy coincidence and deus ex machina against an enemy with no internal structure or motivation.when quiller-couch said authors should ‘murder their darlings’, this is what he meant: just because you have hobbies and opinions does not mean you should fill your novel with them. anything which does not materially contribute to the story, characters, and artistry of a work can safely be left out. tolkien's embarrassment of detail also produced a huge inflation in the acceptable length of fantasy books, leading to the meandering, unending series that fill bookstore shelves today.now, there are several notable critics who have lamented the unfortunate effect that tolkien’s work has had on the genre, such as in moorcock’s \\nepic pooh\\n and mieville’s diatribe about every modern fantasy author being forced to come to terms with the old don's influence. i agree with their deconstructions, but for me, tolkien isn’t some special author, some ‘fantasy granddad’ looming over all. he’s just a bump in the road, one author amongst many in a genre that stretches back thousands of years into our very ideas of myth and identity, and not one of the more interesting oneshis ideas weren’t unique, and while his approach may have been unusual, it was only because he spent a lifetime trying obsessively to make something artificial seem more natural, despite the fact that the point of fantasy (and fiction in general) is to explore the artificial, the human side of the equation, to look at the world through the biased lens of our eye and to represent some odd facet of the human condition. unfortunately, tolkien’s characters, structure, and morality are all too flat to suggest much, no matter how many faux-organic details he surrounds them with.my fantasy book

       "      <td>while other as-yet unreviewed classics confounded me first, heart of darkness by joseph conrad is the latest completed novel on my list of twenty to read this year to help me feel inept as a reader. at first glance, i actually thought this would be much appreciated lighter fare among some of my heftier choices. with only ninety-eight pages from start to finish, it's probably more accurately labeled a short story. those ninety-eight pages, however, took me three weeks to finish.while it didn't actually take me a long time to read, this, as my evening companion, had me choosing almost anything else over reading. tv? yes. shoveling snow? has to be done. bejewled blitz on facebook? it's only a minute (the problem arises when one turns to sixty).when i actually managed to read, the narrative was impressive. joseph conrad was polish and didn't learn english until he was twenty and working on a british merchant ship. not only did he learn english, he mastered it. the vocabulary and description are both beautiful and complex. there are also layers upon layers of metaphor. maybe too many layers. everything was darkness. the water was dark. the forest was dark. the people, chains, moonless night, smoke, room etc. etc. were dark. it felt like a bit much. sure, he had a thesaurus and used words like murky, black, shady but you still knew - he was talking about darkness. got it.upon finishing, i felt a tad superior mocking all the obvious symbolism, as if all of his dark references were the point. then, i read a few reviews from people who clearly have had an english class or ten, and they were mentioning his hidden references to greek mythology and other indirect allusions to more classics i have not read. like i always do when i'm frustrated, i complained to my mother who assured me all those nuances are what make it a classic. she made me feel better about my classics 101 level of understanding and i'm more than happy to leave heart of darkness 403 for people with greek minors. what made me like this book was the sense of accomplishment when the story was finished. conrad, with all of his darkness overkill, does not hand this story over on a platter. the narration is tricky. marlow spends the bulk of the novel speaking in first person, but, occasionally, you realize there is another narrator. it's the guy who is listening to marlow and there's probably an important reason for that shift of responsibility. that, however, is covered in heart of darkness 201. i'm going to let it go.what made me dislike this book was the sense of \"what the heck?\" when the story was finished. jay read this in high school (in high school, people!) and at one point asked me, \"so, have you been introduced to kurtz yet?\" he remembered kurtz, who, i admit, is often mentioned throughout the book. when he asked, i hadn't yet, but his and marlow's awe while mentioning his name added to an overly-hyped sense of anticipation of kurtz's contribution to conrad's novel.kurtz is hardly in the book. what he does, how he does it, where he does it all seem central to the book, but the details, those things that make sense of the rest of the plot, are never given. i know it has something to do with oppression. and racism. and evil. but, my naive little mind doesn't know how far to go. he dies saying, \"the horror! the horror!\" so, it's probably pretty bad. but i don't know! it's just all so....dark.in any case, i'm ready to move on. i'm embarrassed that this apparent high school level reading so kicked my tail. i may need to read some nicholas sparks or stephanie meyer to get some of my mojo back.</td>\n",

(if you’ve never seen this, check it out on youtube starting here -i’ve seen the movie more times than i could ever count. i’ve read gregory maguire’s wicked: the life and times of the wicked witch of the west and son of a witch (not a lion among men yet, although it is on my list) and i’ve seen the broadway production of wicked twice. heck, i’ve even experienced the bizarre synchronicity of pink floyd’s dark side of the moon and the wizard of oz! (if you’ve never seen this, check it out on youtube starting here -http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uw9ssl... – coincidence?? ;)) …yet, incredibly, i have never read the l. frank baum’s books! so after getting a free collection of all these books for my kindle, i finally decided to begin reading these classics.the wonderful wizard of oz is the first of 14 land of oz books written by l. frank baum (not to mention the 18 written by ruth plumly thompson, three by john r. neill, two by jack snow, one by rachel s. cosgrove, and one by eloise jarvis mcgraw &amp; lauren lynn mcgraw.) with the movie, play adaptations, spoofs, and variations that have been written about this one, i hardly find a need to summarize the plot. i once again loved traveling along the yellow brick road with dorothy, toto, the scarecrow, the tin woodsman and the cowardly lion as they headed to the emerald city to seek their heart’s desire. i did find some of the plot differences between the movie and the book interesting, the biggest one being that in the book, dorothy’s journeys in oz are not ascribed to a dream at the end. i like this because it leaves the conclusion up to the reader’s imagination – the reader gets to decide whether the land of oz really exists. also, in terms of characters, we don’t meet the wicked witch of the west until the wizard sends the trio to kill her…and we don’t meet glinda, who is the good witch of the south in the book, until the end of the story (it’s the unnamed good witch of the north that dorothy first meets after her crash landing in munchkinland.) there’s also some additional characters, like the kingdom of mice who rescue the lion from the poppy field and the people made of china…and the real story behind those flying monkeys that scared the heck out of me as a child (they’re not as scary in the book…capable of scary stuff, but also capable of good).in addition to the story itself, some other things really interest me here. first of all, the whole censorship issue…i found it hard to believe that this tale, that is such an integral part of our imagination and popular culture, has actually been challenged to the extent that it has. back in the day, when the books were published, some ministers and educators were opposed to the stories, claiming they promoted witchcraft and were too fanciful. there were some who even said that the books were “ungodly” in their depiction of strong-willed &amp; powerful female characters, an idea that was amazingly supported by many librarians. the 20th century also saw its share of anti-oz sentiments. in 1928, the chicago public library refused to put the book on its shelves, stating that the books were “not literature, but somehow evil for children.” living in florida, i find this embarrassing, but in the 1950s, florida’s state librarian, dorothy dodd, sent out a memo to all the librarians in the state denouncing the oz series, saying that they were “unwholesome for children in your community.” she took this a step further when she declared that the oz books were “not to be purchased, not to be accepted as gifts, not to be processed and not to be circulated.” …and wait…there’s more - even more recently, in 1986, fundamentalist parents in hawkins county, tn challenged the books used in local public schools, claiming that they promoted witchcraft and secular humanism. to further explain this assertion, the lead plaintiff, vicki frost, explained that the stories depicted some witches as good, while of course they are always bad. yikes! (“a federal court handed frost a limited victory by holding that the public school system would have to allow parents who objected to \"opt out\" of lessons featuring the offending literature. the u.s. 6th circuit court of appeals overturned that ruling in 1987, and the u.s. supreme court later refused to hear the case. that action led religious right attorney michael farris, who represented frost, to call on \"every born-again christian to get their children out of public schools.\" http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi...). …and the list goes on…i also always like reading about the possible underlying political symbolism in the wizard of oz. this is something that i learned in a college history course and that my daughter is learning in her ap american history class right now. before i get into it, i always kind of wondered about this. l. frank baum undoubtedly wrote these stories for children as an alternative to some of the stories that were told to him during his childhood…but he also wrote for children of all ages, stating, \"my books are intended for all those whose hearts are young, no matter what their ages may be\" (http://www.literarytraveler.com/liter...). so i think it is totally possible that baum added a little something else that would get the grownups thinking…take a look at some of this symbolism, which comes from the article lions, and tigers, and political symbols, oh my!:• dorothy: dorothy is thought to represent the american people or values. she proves herself to be determined, resourceful, and loyal. another speculation is that she represents theodore roosevelt, the united states president. some people believe this theory more than the other because of the similarities in the names. (think: dor-o-thy and the-o-dore).• toto: small and seemingly going unnoticed, toto is the one who reveals the wizard for the fraud he is. he is thought to be another representation of the average american people.• uncle henry: in the late 1800's, there was a famous farmer who was the editor of a leading farm magazine. his name was henry cantwell wallace, and everyone called him uncle henry. • cyclone: the tornado is thought to represent political upheaval, or the free silver movement. during the time period in which this story was written, farmers were suffering from federal deflation; they were receiving less money for their goods, and their debt was getting larger. they wanted the value of a dollar to have a fixed ratio of both silver and gold. some politicians were behind this movement while others were not.• munchkins: the munchkins were little people who represented the common folk. they were ordinary citizens of the united states. and in the same breath, the lollipop guild is said to represent child labor.• silver slippers: in the book, the slippers that appear on dorothy's feet are silver, rather than ruby. silver relates to the monetary political issues. farmers wanted the value of a dollar to have a fixed ratio of both gold and silver. some have also speculated that the silver slippers represent the power to vote.• yellow brick road: this represents the gold standard, such as a brick of gold. the road of gold leads to power.• oz: oz is an abbreviation for gold, which was a hot political topic with people rallying for a fixed ratio of silver and gold.• tin woodman: the tin woodman has a more obvious meaning. he represented the industrial workers who were often dehumanized. he was rusted an immobile, which is a feeling that many factory workers when businesses began shutting down because of a nation-wide depression. after losing their jobs, they felt helpless.• scarecrow: the scarecrow is thought to represent the western farmers. while his complaint was that he didn't have a brain, he ended up being the most clever problem solver of the four travelers.• cowardly lion: there was a politician named william jennings bryan in the late 1800's who supported the free silver movement. the cowardly lion is said to represent bryan, who was seen has having a loud roar, but no bite, or no power.now i plan to read baum’s other 13 books!</td>\n",

       "      <td>treasure of the rubbermaids 20: failing the voight-kampff testthe on-going discoveries of priceless books and comics found in a stack of rubbermaid containers previously stored and forgotten at my parent’s house and untouched for almost 20 years. thanks to my father dumping them back on me, i now spend my spare time unearthing lost treasures from their plastic depths.in the spirit of phillip k. dick‘s questioning of reality and identity, it’s fitting that there are two versions of this story. one is the novel he wrote in which a police bounty hunter tracks down and destroys androids while he tries to earn enough money to buy a real animal to snap his wife out of a depression. the other is a film version in which a disillusioned ‘blade runner’ is forced to track down and kill dangerous replicants despite his growing sympathy for them. i also like to think that pkd would probably get a laugh because of the approximately one thousand different director’s cuts of the movie available to further confuse us as to which is the ‘real’ story.the world is pretty much a wasteland after a nuclear war, and the smart people are getting off the planet. human-like androids have been developed to help with colonizing other worlds, but they have a habit of returning to earth illegally and trying to hide. police bounty hunters use an empathy test to identify them and then kill them on the spot. rick deckard is called in after the senior bounty hunter was nearly killed while hunting a group of a new type of android. deckard is anxious for the big payday that he’d get because he’s embarrassed at not being able to afford a new animal to replace the fake sheep he bought after his real one died. he hopes that being able to get a real animal again will snap his wife out of the depression she’s in that even their mood organ device can’t fix.if you’re hoping for futuristic tech in this, you’re going to be disappointed. pkd’s strength wasn’t in envisioning what the future would look like, and the idea that deckard’s electric sheep has actual audio tape in it to simulate noises seems laughable now. flying cars and laser tubes seem like the kind of sci-fi you’d get from any pulp writer of the era.but that wasn’t the point, and pkd’s tech was always just an excuse to get at the more interesting issues of questioning reality and identity. in this one, the question is what it means to be human, and the hunt for the androids is used to explore the idea of empathy. it’s also a nice touch that with most of the animals killed by the nuclear fall-out, that owning a real one is the ultimate status symbol and any type of mistreatment is a shocking taboo. deckard longs for an animal to care for while killing things with human faces. are they too deserving of sympathy or is their humanity a mask over an overwhelming desire for self-preservation that essentially makes them all sociopaths? that’s the interesting stuff in this book.even though the blade runner movies adopts the basic story as well as several other elements, it’s not really a faithful adaptation of the book. it’s a sci-fi classic that became the template for the look of dystopian futures in film, but while the two share dna, they feel like different beings in a lot of ways. (i think that richard linklater’s rotoscoped verson of a scanner darkly is probably the best adaption of pkd’s work in capturing it’s tone and theme.)</td>\n",

       "      <td>read for banned books week 2012 - click here for my giveaway of a book of your choice from the ala's list of banned and challenged books! (open until 6th october 2012)fourteen year old celie and her younger sister nettie are the oldest children in a large, turbulent family. their ma sickens and dies, and their pa brings home a new bride about the same age as celie. none of this stops him from taking advantage of celie and getting two babies on her, and then turning his sight onto prettier nettie. celie advises her sister to marry the older man who's interested in her, so as to escape their pa, but pa won't have it, and instead tells mr that he can have celie. mr is already a widower with three \"rotten\" children, and takes celie to look after them. nettie comes to stay, but when she resists mr's advances, he tells her she has to go. that's the last time celie sees her sister or hears from her, because she doesn't receive nettie's letters, not for the longest time.nettie is taken in by corrine and her husband, a kind reverend called samuel. their two little children, olivia and adam, were adopted though they don't know it - and they happen to be the children celie gave birth to and misses dearly. nettie is like one of the family, and after several years with them, she travels with them to africa as a missionary. there they live with a tribe called the olinka, inland off the west coast, and nettie continues to write to celie, telling her all about the olinka, her impressions of being black but not truly african, and what happens when the europeans take over the land and destroy the forest for the sake of a rubber plantation.meanwhile, celie keeps her head down in mr's house, though he beats her anyway. he's been in love with a sexy singer all his life, called shug avery, and when shug comes to live with them, celie starts falling in love with her too. celie's never had anyone in her life love her, except her sister nettie, and she believes her to be dead. but shug starts to love her back, and celie learns courage with which to change things, for her own sake.this is one very impressive, beautiful novel. i knew little about it before starting it - little more than that it gets frequently challenged in american schools by parents upset over the language and content - and had got the impression that it was one of those heavy, depressing stories where lots of bad, unpleasant things happen to women. to black women (if i was expecting anything, it was a sentimental, melodramatic, self-indulgent novel - which couldn't be further from the reality). well it does seem to start off that way, but it's really not like that at all.this is an epistolary novel, told in diary entries by celie to god, and then later to nettie, and in letters from nettie to celie. walker writes with incredible skill: in the beginning, celie's entries are short and poorly written, her thoughts leaping without apparent connection, so that it is like picking up puzzle pieces off the floor and trying to match them up. it is hard to get a sense of time passing (she states her age, fourteen, at the beginning, but it's not much of a marker for how much time has passed between entries, or how old she is when things happen), and of events because she'll just suddenly mention something, and it's hard to tell if it's happening \"now\" or was from the past - her grammar is that bad. but her voice is strong with her personality, even if her personality isn't a strong one: she's not like sofia, her step-son's wife, who's big and strong and confident and punches back when harpo tries to put her in line by beating her. you get plenty of mental exercise, reading this book, reading between the lines and piecing things together, but as celie's writing improves along with her situation, it becomes much easier to follow things. she always retains her wonderful voice, though, with its distinct diction and phonetic spelling which always gets across the colour and flavour of the setting, the other characters, how they feel.this time kate [mr's sister] come by herself. she maybe twenty-five. old maid. she look younger than me. healthy. eyes bright. tongue sharp.buy celie some clothes. she say to mr.___________.she need clothes? he ast.well look at her.he look at me. it like he looking at the earth. it need somethin? his eyes say.she go with me in the store. i think what color shug avery would wear. she like a queen to me so i say to kate, somethin purple, maybe little red in it too. but us look an look and no purple. plenty red but she say, naw, he won't want to pay for red. too happy lookin. we got choice of brown, maroon or navy blue. i say blue.i can't remember being the first one in my own dress. now to have one made just for me. i try to tell kate what it mean. i git hot in the face and stutter.she say. it's all right, celie. you deserve more than this.maybe so. i think. [pp.20-21]there is so much going on in this book, it's hard to know where to start. set sometime during the first world war, at the beginning, it ends during the second world war. it is somewhere in the american south, but i don't remember it clearly saying where exactly - other cities and states are referred to, but not where celie lives. it is of course after the abolition of slavery, but segregation and prejudice thrives. there is a strong sense of realism, from the way the characters talk (everyone is black unless mentioned otherwise), to the things that happen to them. through the characters' voices, walker is brutally honest and unflinching in her depiction of life for black people in the american south, and elsewhere.this is a story about emancipation of the soul: celie especially grows a great deal over the course of the novel, from a quiet, beaten down girl who believes what the abusive men in her life say about her, who believes as a matter of course in the god that is preached at her in church, into a mature woman who - still quietly - takes charge of her life and makes something of it. it is a story about the strength of women, and about the gender stereotypes that hold back both women and men - the men are almost caricatures of lazy, stubborn, demanding, superior beings who think women are not good for much, without recognising that they do all the work and are often simply too afraid to speak up for themselves (and the men wouldn't listen anyway).harpo want to know what to do to make sofia mind. he sit out on the porch with mr._________. he say, i tell her one thing, she do another. never do what i say. always backtalk.to tell the truth, he sound a little proud of this to me.mr._________ don't say nothing. blow smoke.i tell her she can't be all the time going to visit her sister. us married now, i tell her. your place is here with the children. she say, i'll take the children with me. i say, your place is with me. she say, you want to come? she keep primping in front of the glass, getting the children ready at the same time.you ever hit her? mr._________ ast.harpo look down at his hands. naw suh, he say low, embarrass.well how you spect to make her mind? wives is like children. you have to let 'em know who got the upper hand. nothing can do that better than a good sound beating.he puff on his pipe.sofia think too much of herself anyway, he say. she need to be taken down a peg. [p.35]of course, what comes across to the reader is the irony: that it's the men who behave like children in celie's world: petulant, sulky, unhelpful, abusive - okay that's not children, but you get what i mean. it was just beautiful to me, seeing the principle male characters also grow and change, partly forced to it by the women who find their strength, and how much more content and happier they are when they're no longer lazy and abusive and neglectful. i warmed to them all. none of the characters are black-and-white - although, the only real white people who feature, the mayor and his family, are sketches of white prejudice and privilege - and it is in their complex shades of grey that walker excels at bringing them to life.another aspect is the dichotomy, if i can call it that, of black people - the ones sold by their own people to white slavers and shipped to the american colonies, and the \"real\" africans in africa. it is impressive, what walker managed to capture and articulate in such a relatively short novel. in one of nettie's letters to celie, while en route to africa from england, she says:although africans once had a better civilization than the european ... for several centuries they have fallen on hard times. \"hard times\" is a phrase the english love to use, when speaking of africa. and it is easy to forget that africa's \"hard times\" were made harder by them. millions and millions of africans were captured and sold into slavery - you and me, celie! and whole cities were destroyed by slave catching wars. today the people of africa - having murdered or sold into slavery their strongest folks - are riddled by disease and sunk in spiritual and physical confusion. they believe in the devil and worship the dead. nor can they read or write.why did they sell us? how could they have done it? and why do we still love them? [p.139]the juxtaposition of the black descendants of slaves in america with the \"original\" africans on their ancestral land, is vivid and fascinating. nettie is bright, well educated (self educated), kind, generous and open-minded. and she conjures spectacular visions:the capital city of senegal is dakar and the people speak their own language, senegalese i guess they would call it, and french. they are the blackest people i have ever seen, celie. they are black like the people we are talking about when we say, \"so and so is blacker than black, he's blueblack.\" they are so black, celie, they shine. which is something else folks down home like to say about real black folks. but celie, try to imagine a city full of these shining, blueblack people wearing brilliant blue robes with designs l...</td>\n",

       "      <td>every time i shelve the barnes and noble classic version of this book (and sometimes when i shelve other versions), this song runs through my head (or technically the one line in the chorus), \"pretty persuasion\". this version of it by jawbreaker, not the original rem version (which is embarrassing, why you may ask? i could have just stated the song and moved on with the review, or i could be honest about some failing on my part that no one probably needs to know (would i be a more better awesomest top reviewer full of win if i just stopped with all of this 'honesty' painting myself as some hapless moron nonsense, what if i used product in my hair? i dream of being more like mr. elliot (father or cousin, now that i think of it, but cousin was in my mind when i said that))(still in a parentheses in case your wondering). for years, like five of them or so, i've misattributed this song to being a psychedelic furs song, not just as originally done by them and then covered by jawbreaker, but as in the version i was hearing in my head as by the psychedelic furs and not a cover version performed by my favorite band ever. what an awful fan i am. although i've never been that big on the etc., collection where this can be found, nor ever interested in rem enough to purchase more than two or three of their albums, nevermind a tribute cd to them (and yes, \"pretty persuasion\" is on one of the rem records i own (although thinking about rem now i realize that i only ever bought one rem record, the other two i owned were given to me as christmas gifts (you needed to know this information, seriously)))). if i had ever gone through with tattooing the four f's on to my arm or leg like i really meant to have done i would be right now burning the tattoo off of my body with the cooking flame throwing thing my sister gave me for christmas in 2009 instead of writing this review). so this book has the soundtrack of blake rasping, \"goddamn pretty persuasion\" in my head pretty much anytime that i see or think about the book. i think this is an ok thing, i could totally see anne as listening to jawbreaker if the story had been set in the 1990's or 2000's instead of the early nineteenth century.*part of me wants to just write a review calling this a romance novel, just to incite some of my goodreads friends, but i won't do that. if this were a romance novel i think it would be fairly unsatisfying. the ending felt sort of like a foregone conclusion from the first couple of chapters (although i'm not the target audience for romances, and my guess is that most readers of romance novels can kind of guess the ending to just about any romance novel, and i guess it's the route taken or something that makes them interesting, i don't know. i am not someone to ask anything related to romance about (most un-romantic thing i've ever done? told my sophomore year college girlfriend (maybe i will relate more tales from this relationship some other time when i'm at a loss for personal shit to divulge instead of actually writing about the book i'm supposed to be reviewing) soon after returning to school in january how i wasn't going to get her anything for valentines day because it was just a consumer holiday designed to sell crap to people. unromantic? i then made sure to harp on my refusing to take part in valentines day almost daily up until the actual day), see? what do i know about romance). instead i was surprised (i guess, i don't know what i was expecting from jane austen actually) to find the book a lot like the fun parts of proust. her characters were as comically stuffy, delusional and as interesting as the various people who populated the drawing rooms of marcel's social world. but unlike proust's marcel, anne is sort of the rational calm in the middle of the storm of personalities and not a borderline sociopath who is critical but really right at home with all of the other psychological malcontents populating the novel. i really liked the book and this is a very strong four star rating. my only complaint with the book, and what probably kept it from getting the fifth star, is the style of writing, which is more the conventions of the time than the actual content. but i would proudly bring this book or maybe even another jane austen novel with me to a future ufc event and maybe even sit and read a few pages in between fights while some remix of rage against the machine with extra hip-hop beats was played at teeth rattling volumes, and i would have no problem asking some passing mma personality for an autograph and open up jane austen to the title page to get their john hancock. like anne and her feelings about her broken engagement to captain wentworth i'll be regretting not getting skyscrape** from tapout or trainer greg jackson to sign and make my copy of jane austen the most badass on the planet until i can rectify this situation. i only hope it doesn't take eight years of pining before i get the chance to set things right. *another band i could see the modern day anne listening to (yes, she's been projected to being some kind of cool but unnoticed indie girl in my reimagining) would be the other band that supplies a soundtrack to the shelving of a jane austen book. that would be (obviously) belle and sebastian's \"just a modern rock song\" for emma (\"emma tried to run away, i followed her across the city\"). **greg jackson looks like a normal person, so i'm not going to share a picture of him, but this is what skyscrape looks like:doesn't he look like the type of guy who just needs have his signature saved in a jane austen book?</td>\n",

       "      <td>the word persuasion appears thirteen times in jane austen's first novel, sense and sensibility. it appears only seven times in her last novel, although her brother henry, who published it posthumously, chose it as the title. i'm guessing that austen might have objected to this because her novel is about so much more than the merits and demerits of pliability as a characteristic. i was struck by many things as i read this poolside in delray beach, florida- a twenty-first century bath. as always, miss austen is her wickedly sardonic self, and the tone of the novel seems both elegiac and radical. her heroine, anne elliot has good sense, a kind heart, a delicate, fading beauty...and the worst relatives ever imagined! her widowed father, a baronet, and her two sisters are vain, vapid narcissists without an ounce of sense between them. sir walter is a piece of work, a preening peacock who is as mean-spirited as he is stupid, having squandered the family fortune. austen is no friend to the nobility - lady catherine de bourgh and lady bertram are famous objects of her derision - but no one is as despicable as sir walter elliot, or as duplicitous as his cousin and eventual heir, william elliot. she has great fun mocking them, but she also reminds us that poor anne must suffer embarrassment for them, humiliation by them and the loss of her beloved home because of them.\\n\\nthis being a classic cinderella story, anne requires a prince charming to rescue her. she had broken her engagement to a poor young man years before, having been persuaded by others that he was beneath her. he returns triumphantly as the rich captain wentworth, a naval hero in search of a wife. he has persuaded himself that anne's past behavior was unforgivable and he seems to be rubbing her nose in it. his circle of friends, naval officers and their wives, provides a sharp contrast to the aristocracy. as i read, i wondered what austen might have thought if she'd been privy to herman melville's, billy budd, sailor but concluded that she is entitled to her romantic notions and, besides, it serves her larger mission to elevate one class as she denigrates another. she isn't just nitpicking here; her nobles are as ignoble as anyone invented by charles dickens or f. scott fitzgerald. i'd like to think that austen would be sympathetic to the occupy wall street crowd but truthfully, she might have just as easily become a tea party radical. she sees nothing wrong with great wealth if it is used to good ends and if the wealthy are of good character. what makes reading this such a pleasure is the comforting idea that anyone can recover from youthful mistakes, and that second chances are not only possible, but are desirable outcomes for people who are open to possibilities.</td>\n",

       "      <td>writing a critique of this book is a somewhat melancholic obligation as i'm thinking that it was the last step of a brilliant literary cariere that was prematurely ended. no one knows how many masterpieces she would have written and in which paths would  had lead literature in general. what we know by reading this book is that the great writer was meant to sail for different seas as she were dealing with different themes and - as the experts say - were experimenting more in writing.the story that she narrates has many autobiographical details. its main core, which is surely inspired by her brother's professional career in the navy, is the life of some of his colleagues at the end of the napoleonic wars, a life that drastically changes and pushes some to seek a life on the land where they can enjoy the profits they had earned but also the highest social status and the prestige offered by their services for their country. this social rise is described by the writer through the case of a navy officer who once made a marriage proposal to a young woman of the aristocracy, our heroine, but despite her initial positive response, she was persuaded by her familly to refuse because they considered his social position much lower. years later this couple is meeting again and things seem to be completely different. the only thing that does not change is the feelings that unite them - or divide them - which remain the same.there is the other autobiographical element as the writer had passed the stage of a woman unmarried at the age of 27, where women of the time decided to definitively take on the role of the spinster who lives only to serve others. this life of the spinster she is presenting us in her own brilliant way, with a strong self-sarcastic mood that leads to many delightful literary moments. of course at this age marriage was not unthinkable, there were still chances, but what changed was the fact that the situation was considered urgent and the pressure to accept any proposal led to funny situations and sad thoughts. of course, these suggestions were obviously not the best and their motives were not always honest, as - as the book says - the competition from younger and prettier women was intense unless, of course, there was love in the middle.all this makes this book very interesting, but my particular love for it is by the fact that, despite its sarcastic character, i find in it a greater dose of tenderness. the meeting of the two old lovers takes place in a climate of delightful embarrassment and their relationship continues through remorse and successive flushes when emotions become stronger. from the cute physical manifestations of love, we go into thoughts about the nature of this beautiful feeling, ending in its very touching effect that has between a man and a woman, however different they approach love. in the end there is the classic romantic view that manifests with the writer's love for nature and more for the sea, which is constantly crossed by people honest and truthful. with all of this, it is impossible for me not to be totally excited reaching the last page.το γράψιμο μιας κριτικής για αυτό το βιβλίο είναι μία κάπως μελαγχολική υποχρέωση καθώς σκέφτομαι ότι ήταν το τελευταίο βήμα μιας λαμπρής συγγραφικής πορείας που διακόπηκε πολύ πρόωρα. κανείς δεν ξέρει πόσα ακόμα αριστουργήματα θα είχε γράψει και σε ποια μονοπάτια θα οδηγούσαν γενικότερα τη λογοτεχνία. αυτό που ξέρουμε διαβάζοντας αυτό το βιβλίο είναι ότι η μεγάλη συγγραφέας είχε σκοπό να σαλπάρει για διαφορετικές θάλασσες καθώς ασχολούνταν με διαφορετικά θέματα και - όπως λένε οι ειδικοί - πειραματίζονταν περισσότερο με τον τρόπο γραφής της.ιστορία που αφηγείται έχει πολλά αυτοβιογραφικά στοιχεία. ο βασικός κορμός της, που σίγουρα είναι εμπνευσμένος από την επαγγελματική σταδιοδρομία του αδελφού της στο ναυτικό είναι η ζωή κάποιων συναδέλφων του μετά το τέλος των ναπολεόντειων πολέμων, μία ζωή που φυσικά αλλάζει δραστικά και ωθεί κάποιους να αναζητήσουν μία ζωή στη στεριά όπου θα μπορούν να απολαύσουν τα κέρδη που είχαν αποκομίσει αλλά και την υψηλότερη κοινωνική θέση και το πρεστίζ που τους προσέφεραν οι υπηρεσίες τους στην πατρίδα. αυτήν την κοινωνική άνοδο περιγράφει η συγγραφέας μέσα από την περίπτωση ενός ναυτικού που κάποτε έκανε πρόταση γάμου σε μία νεαρή γυναίκα της αριστοκρατίας, την ηρωίδα μας, αλλά παρά την αρχική θετική της απάντηση πείστηκε από τους δικούς της να αρνηθεί γιατί θεωρούσαν ότι η κοινωνική του θέση ως αξιωματικός του ναυτικού ήταν πολύ χαμηλότερη. αργότερα, μετά από χρόνια, αυτό το ζευγάρι ξανασυναντιέται και τα πράγματα φαίνεται να είναι εντελώς διαφορετικά. το μόνο που δεν αλλάζει είναι τα συναισθήματα που τους ενώνουν - ή τους χωρίζουν -, τα οποία παραμένουν το ίδιο έντονα. εκεί είναι και το άλλο αυτοβιογραφικό στοιχείο καθώς η συγγραφέας είχε περάσει από το στάδιο μιας γυναίκας ανύπαντρης στην ηλικία των 27 ετών, όπου οι γυναίκες της εποχής αποφάσιζαν οριστικά να πάρουν το ρόλο της γεροντοκόρης που ζει μόνο για να εξυπηρετεί τους άλλους. αυτή τη ζωή της γεροντοκόρης την παρουσιάζει με τον δικό της πανέξυπνο τρόπο, με μία έντονη αυτοσαρκαστική διάθεση που οδηγεί σε πολλά απολαυστικά λογοτεχνικά στιγμιότυπα. βέβαια σε αυτήν την ηλικία ο γάμος δεν ήταν κάτι το αδιανόητο, υπήρχαν και τότε ευκαιρίες, αυτό, όμως, που άλλαζε ήταν το γεγονός ότι η κατάσταση θεωρούνταν επείγουσα και η πίεση για αποδοχή οποιασδήποτε πρότασης οδηγούσε σε αστείες καταστάσεις αλλά και σε λυπητερές σκέψεις. φυσικά αυτές οι προτάσεις προφανώς δεν ήταν και οι καλύτερες και τα κίνητρά τους δεν ήταν πάντοτε τίμια καθώς - όπως φαίνεται και στο βιβλίο - ο ανταγωνισμός από νεότερες και ομορφότερες γυναίκες ήταν έντονος, εκτός αν, φυσικά, υπήρχε ο έρωτας στη μέση.όλα αυτά κάνουν αυτό το βιβλίο να είναι πολύ ενδιαφέρον αλλά ο δικός μου λόγος μου το αγάπησα ιδιαίτερα είναι το γεγονός ότι, παρά τον σαρκαστικό του χαρακτήρα, εντοπίζω μέσα σε αυτό μία μεγαλύτερη δόση τρυφερότητας. η συνάντηση των δύο παλιών εραστών γίνεται μέσα σε ένα κλίμα αξιαγάπητης αμηχανίας και η σχέση τους συνεχίζεται μέσα από τύψεις και αλλεπάλληλα κοκκινίσματα όταν τα συναισθήματα γίνονται εντονότερα. από τις χαριτωμένες σωματικές εκδηλώσεις του έρωτα περνάμε σε σκέψεις για τη φύση αυτού του όμορφο αισθήματος, καταλήγοντας στην πολύ συγκινητική επίδραση μου έχει ανάμεσα σε έναν άντρα και σε μία γυναίκα, όσο διαφορετικά και αν τον προσεγγίζουν. στο τέλος υπάρχει και ο κλασικός ρομαντισμός που εκδηλώνεται με την αγάπη της συγγραφέως για τη φύση και περισσότερο για τη θάλασσα, την οποία διασχίζουν συνεχώς άνθρωποι τίμιοι και ειλικρινείς. με όλα αυτά μου είναι αδύνατο να μην είμαι απόλυτα συγκινημένος φτάνοντας στην τελευταία σελίδα.</td>\n",

       "      <td>i don't put pics or gifs in reviews, but right now i've got a mental image of a non-specific peanuts character running round in small circles, arms up, mouth open, going: yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!!i finished this. when i decided last year that actually, yes, i would read anna karenina, (of which i'd had copies on and off since c.2002) i planned to start a post by saying i was one of the few people who'd ever started the book because of - not in spite of - all the material about rural life and agriculture.actually, there wasn't nearly enough of it relative to the amount of society conversation.anyway. i've said most of what i want to say about anna karenina elsewhere. if you can be arsed reading lots of snippets, it's:- in my comments on two threads started by others (pasted now, not just linked - i've been careful not to include other people's words, but my comments are still indebted to them, having been bounced off them):junei was reading that bit [the mowing scene] yesterday, so the detail about the scythes is esp. appreciated. whichever version though, it's still awesome to read that scene on a lawn in the sunshine.as said elsewhere i am reading p&amp;v [fnar] but just because i already had it and didn't greatly prefer the newer translations i looked at (eg bartlett, schwartz). perhaps there are scenes which different translators do better, and garnett came out tops on this one.they have not annoyed me as much so far in ak as in w&amp;p, although the term 'self-esteem' in a conversation between levin and his half brother jarred. would sound out of place for 1975, never mind 1875. whatever happened to 'self-respect'? ---------the descriptions of countryside &amp; gardens are my favourite thing about tolstoy. (in w&amp;p e.g. the sleigh ride and christmas, and when andrei[?]rides to bald hills during the war.) -----------i had searched for food in anna karenina, wondering if a blogger had perhaps cooked and photographed some.found this other translation of a paragraph (garnett? not sure.)http://www.russianfoods.com/en/peasan...it sounds unappetising, would probably never have searched for the food if i'd read that first off.it may of course just be the naming of dishes, e.g. \"little patties\" sounds like corned beef. and goose is hard work to cook and not, imo quite worth the effort. [not always been vegetarian]the dreaded pevear &amp; volokhonsky:the efforts of agafya mikhailovna and the cook to make an especially good dinner had as their only result that the two hungry friends, sitting down to the hors d'oeuvres, ate their fill of bread and butter, polotok and pickled mushrooms, and that levin ordered the soup served without the pirozhki, with which the cook had wanted especially to to surprise the guest. but stepan arkadyevich, though accustomed to different dinners, found everything excellent: the herb liqueur, and the bread and butter, and, especially the polotok, the mushrooms, the nettle soup, the chicken with white sauce, and the white crimean wine - everything was excellent and wonderful.--------'polotok' is footnoted. i prefer that - plenty of local terms and explanations instead of trying to anglicise everything.in the same way, 'dumplings' would bring to mind something like these:http://jensfoodandphotos.blogspot.co....so would rather they say 'pirozhki'.septemberi'm afraid i got exasperated with ak and have...35% still to go after several phases of reading it this year. not something i'm expecting many to agree with on gr.lev can be so victorian sometimes and that quote sounds like one of those moments.and then there's the accidental innuendo side, which i can't help reading in because of the scene with kitty and the doctor. (not actually p&amp;v's fault that time...) ---------usually i've been all for arguing for historical context and concomitant patience - e.g. that these characters couldn't help it due to social conditioning and also because of having their breathing and movement restricted by corsets and crinolines.but i got fed up with it in ak regardless. i was just bloody sick of reading about them. maybe the patience i thought i'd always had has a limit of 4-500 pages.then re. the affair plot, similar. tired of hearing about these people pacing round and round, encaged by a broken system - someone just invent polyamory already ffs.also could never forget that they were invented creatures of tolstoy's mind, this pompous paterfamilias; couldn't think about them as real, any opinions i might have of them couldn't be anything other than tentative: tired of wondering what was tolstoy and what was representative of real russian c.1870s women.wanted to be reading memoir instead, to be without that sort of complication...the old popular idea of being a \"tolstoy person\" or a \"dostoevsky person\" seems to be a false dichotomy among familiar people on gr, but i think i'm the latter: i wanted to hear more about the run-down political activist brother, about the servants. almost anyone seemed more interesting than the main characters...i wouldn't be surprised if the level of repression was such that a writer wouldn't be fully conscious if the innuendo. he sowed his wild oats but he seems to have been so caught up in his ideals and his idea of how and who he wanted to be, that there wasn't room for seeing himself otherwise.but tolstoy is still less prudish than his british contemporaries and includes things it would have been improper for them to. which is interesting imo.although one surprising aspect of the book was how normal anna and vronsky were - average members of their class who got hijacked by passionate love. the tone of the book seems to reflect that they have always been conventional conformists apart from this. but in the end i enjoyed more florid stories of such affairs, romanticism, where the writing was more sympathetic to the characters, less detached, more swept up in the moment e.g. confession of a child of the century.... i think i ... look for a particular idea of russianness, and dostoevsky satisfies that for me, whereas tolstoy - whilst interesting to know about and obviously a major part of the culture - i find too similar to english victorian to love. --------- i hadn't been able to articulate why the idea of an orrery [which i used in my war &amp; peace review] wasn't entirely positive (they are pretty little machines) - but yes, the lack of chaos, or the feel of that, and the attendant excitement is what's missing. one or two unexpected things did happen later in the book, but it was soon back to business as usual.i also think of formal dances to represent the structure of some classic novels: usually an image from some tv adaptation...from the little i've read (there was no shortage of russian novels in the house when i was growing up, but only recently started reading any for myself) my impression is of some things speeded up, some things slowed down as compared with w. euro history. during ak, serfdom has been abolished for only about 10 years, but the more progressive side of the dinner party discussion about women's education and role in society is more modern than anything i remember seeing in british novels of the same age. the lack of prudery could equally seem c18th or c20th compared with britain depending on how one looks at it - my impression is they skipped some of the extremes of victorian english morality, but so did much of the continent. i haven't really read russian social history either, but imperial russians, including characters in conversation later in ak, thought of themselves as behind the west in many respects and eager to catch up.most of the c19th lit i've read was in my early to mid teens (&gt;20yrs ago, argh). now perhaps i think more actively about the downsides of that world, and feel more strongly an idea of what it might have been like to be in it, rather than just passively accepting that's how things were.---------this discussion has persuaded me to pick up anna karenina again; now a whole extra 10% further forward, nearly at the end of part vi. the novel seems like less of a burden after this. i think i only really love tolstoy when he writes about countryside and scenery - i'm too rarely sure about the people - so his two big books will be quite enough for me. - detailed notes and occasional rants whilst reading:a) for parts i-v in the status updates below the review box (includes smutty interpretation of a scene featuring kitty). b) for parts vi-viii in three comments below. (both sets of summaries are pretty detailed; i've only treated events that surprised me most as spoilers - didn't mention them directly or used spoiler tags.)for months, up to this week, i'd associated my boredom of the characters with an almost physical sense of having a couple of dozen crumpled-paper balls thrown at me, by goodreads collectively. after the second of those two conversations, that entirely disappeared. (gr thread as talking therapy?... anyway, am grateful to find sympathy somewhere for a minority opinion like this one). i read on, now contentedly accepting that i would not get much enjoyment from, or want to pay excruciating attention to the detail of, the endless drawing room and gentlemen's club conversations.yes, fellow non-fans of pevear and volokhonsky, this was their translation, but i don't think that made much difference. in their war &amp; peace i was irritated by word choices and sentence structures, but here it was more fundamental: personalities, settings, cumulative attitudes that couldn't be so very different in another translation.this won't be a popular opinion - and after months i gloriously do not feel that as any burden or embarrassment - but i think i've had enough of tolstoy now. after all, w&amp;p + ak = more pages and more time than i've spent with many of my favourite authors.</td>\n",

       "      <td>for me, this was one of those books regarded as a classic, which you are thus supposed to like more than you would on its merits alone. i certainly appreciate hurston's place in american cultural history, and the importance of the movement to which this novel belongs. the tense last 30 pages or so saved it for me a little, and i always appreciate expanding my base of cultural knowledge. that said, i just didn't enjoy the book very much, in my own subjective way.hurston was apparently praised for her realistic depiction of southern african-american vernacular, but i found it really tough to get through all the \"ah\"s and \"tuh\"s. i also found the pacing to be very uneven. rambling internal monologues* occupy long stretches, where important events are introduced and glossed over abruptly. (view spoiler)[when janie and tea cake first move to jacksonville, he steals her money and disappears for a night of partying on the town, but it's all forgotten instantly when he says he was just embarrassed about the people he usually associates with. tea cake decides to start beating her to show, um, that he loves her and to illustrate to outside threats that he is in control of their relationship, and after two or three pages it's never mentioned again. janie shoots a rabid tea cake at the end, then she goes on trial, then the townspeople all turn on her, then she gets acquitted, then the townspeople all apologize, then she goes home to eatonville, the end. (hide spoiler)] it just seemed to lack a coherent narrative - why introduce such important plot elements, if they are just going to be glossed over?really, the circumstances surrounding the novel's creation, and hurston herself, are far more interesting to me. she wrote the book while in haiti on a guggenheim fellowship to study vodou. she had been living in new york, embroiled in a passionate relationship with a man twenty years her junior, and as a fiercely independent woman saw the trip as an opportunity to cut the relationship off. (at least that's the story provided by hurston biographer valerie boyd at the end of the book.) i think i would enjoy the work that came out of her studies, tell my horse, much more. * example, p. 90:most humans didn’t love one another nohow, and this mislove was so strong that even common blood couldn’t overcome it all the time. she had found a jewel down inside herself and she had wanted to walk where people could see her and gleam it around. but she had been set in the market-place to sell. been set for still-bait. when god had made the man, he made him out of stuff that sung all the time and glittered all over. then after that some angels got jealous and chipped him into millions of pieces, but still he glittered and hummed. so they beat him down to nothing but sparks but each little spark had a shine and a song. so they covered each one over with mud. and the lonesomeness in the sparks make them hunt for one another, but the mud is deaf and dumb. like all the other tumbling mud-balls, janie had tried to show her shine.say what now?</td>\n",

       "      <td>all the starsthis book seemingly had three strikes against it, before i even cracked open the spine. first off, as i’ve stated numerous times before, i’m not a fan of war stories. and i especially don’t care to revisit vietnam, so soon after wading through king’s hearts in atlantis. secondly, nonfiction is not my thing . . . at all. that dry, voiceless prose or lengthy expository info dumps, which seem to populate many works, are dead boring. i’d much rather be whisked away into some page-turning adventure. the third and final strike is that, although i’ve read plenty of these short story collections over the last few years, i’m still not entirely sold on their overall merit. short little vignettes are fine for casual browsing, but i've always preferred a lengthier tale to properly flesh out the characters. all these preconceived notions, yet i couldn't rid my thoughts of something jeff said early on in his read through–and i’m paraphrasing here–“so far, this is an absolutely breathtaking read, check out that titular story and you'll be hooked.” i also vaguely remember amanda's ringing endorsement from a few years back, which put this on my radar to begin with. so rather begrudgingly, i finally picked up the book to see what all the fuss was about. now, i’m happy to report, before god and country, that all those prejudices were unwarranted. this book just flat out works. while technically this may be a categorized as a short story collection, in reality, all of the individual tales interweave and overlap to tell a broader, more powerful and poignant story. the same could be said of truth and fiction. o’brien has no qualms about mixing half-truths or even outright falsehoods into an otherwise faithful recounting of events. or is any of it true? who’s to say, other than the people that were actually there? however, he isn't trying to fool us or have us playing some guessing game. rather, he employs this technique in an attempt to get at the heart of the matter. to get at what he likes to refer to as “story-truth.” he wants you to feel what he felt, experience it firsthand, and in order to accomplish that you have to realize that sometimes “story-truth” is truer than “happening-truth.” whatever the method, the results are undeniable. some of the harrowing scenes described in this book will stick to your bones. much like the horrors witnessed or perpetrated by the soldiers themselves, they’ll not easily be scrubbed away. or what about that intense out-of-body feeling of aliveness you experience after a firefight? how you find yourself studying the vivid colors of the grass and the trees and the river. how you're awed by the sunset, and “filled with a hard, aching love for how the world could be and always should be, but now is not.” o’brien also addresses the lasting impact the war has had on all their lives. to truly appreciate the soldiers’ plight you need to become conscious of the fact that it doesn’t end on the battlefield. perusing this story, i found myself highlighting huge passages, which are much too long to include in any review, so i’ll simply implore you, if you’re anything like me, to set aside those preconceived notions and pick up this book. you won’t regret it. this masterpiece would make a welcome addition to any collection.5 stars – i’m off to track down a hardcover of my own.on second thought, for anyone curious to sample his writing or believe me to be overselling it, check the spoiler for a couple of lengthy quotes from said titular story. (view spoiler)[they carried all the emotional baggage of men who might die. grief, terror, love, longing—these were intangibles, but the intangibles had their own mass and specific gravity, they had tangible weight. they carried shameful memories. they carried the common secret of cowardice barely restrained, the instinct to run or freeze or hide, and in many respects, this was the heaviest burden of all, for it could never be put down, it required perfect balance and perfect posture. they carried their reputations. they carried the soldier's greatest fear, which was the fear of blushing. men killed and died because they were embarrassed not to. it was what had brought them to the war in the first place, nothing positive, no dreams of glory or honor, just to avoid the blush of dishonor. they died so as not to die of embarrassment. they crawled into tunnels and walked point and advanced under fire. each morning, despite the unknowns, they made their legs move. they endured. they kept humping. they did not submit to the obvious alternative, which was simply to close the eyes and fall. so easy, really. go limp and tumble to the ground and let the muscles unwind and not speak and not budge until your buddies picked you up and lifted you into the chopper that would roar and dip its nose and carry you off to the world. a mere matter of falling, yet no one ever fell. it was not courage, exactly; the object was not valor. rather, they were too frightened to be cowards.. . .at night, on guard, staring into the dark, they were carried away by jumbo jets. they felt the rush of takeoff. gone! they yelled. and then velocity—wings and engines—a smiling stewardess—but it was more than a plane, it was a real bird, a big sleek silver bird with feathers and talons and high screeching. they were flying. the weights fell off; there was nothing to bear. they laughed and held on tight, feeling the cold slap of wind and altitude, soaring, thinking it's over, i'm gone!—they were naked, they were light and free—it was all lightness, bright and fast and buoyant, light as light, a helium buzz in the brain, a giddy bubbling in the lungs as they were taken up over the clouds and the war, beyond duty, beyond gravity and mortification and global entanglements—sin loi!, they yelled. i'm sorry, motherfuckers, but i'm out of it, i'm goofed, i'm on a space cruise, i'm gone!

       "      <td>audiobook narrated by bryan cranston ( 7h 47m)  all of us, i suppose, like to believe that in a moral emergency we will behave like the heroes of our youth, bravely and forthrightly, without thought of personal loss or discredit. certainly that was my conviction back in the summer of 1968. tim o'brien: a secret hero. the lone ranger. if the stakes ever became high enough—if the evil were evil enough, if the good were good enough—i would simply tap a secret reservoir of courage that had been accumulating inside me over the years. courage, i seemed to think, comes to us in finite quantities, like an inheritance, and by being frugal and stashing it away and letting it earn interest, we steadily increase our moral capital in preparation for that day when the account must be drawn down. it was a comforting theory. it dispensed with all those bothersome little acts of daily courage; it offered hope and grace to the repetitive coward; it justified the past while amortizing the future. a teacher friend in the u.s mentioned that this is one of the books she covers in her senior ap lit class. so a shout out to my friend athena for her recommendation! the things they carried reminded me of my experience reading lonesome dove. although completely opposite in subject- one being the american west and the other, vietnam in 1968, what strikes me about both is that the authors are leading us into the world of men. how they think, feel, speak, joke, and deal with the memories of a war that many would prefer to forget. it is unabashedly a male world that i as a female reader was entering. or should i say a female reader that has never fought in a war? what would be the lesson that tim o'brien would try to teach me?  a true war story is never moral. it does not instruct, nor encourage virtue, nor suggest models of proper human behavior, nor restrain men from doing the things men have always done. if a story seems moral, do not believe it. if at the end of a war story you feel uplifted, or if you feel that some small bit of rectitude has been salvaged from the larger waste, then you have been made the victim of a very old and terrible lie. there is no rectitude whatsoever. there is no virtue. as a first rule of thumb, therefore, you can tell a true war story by its absolute and uncompromising allegiance to obscenity and evil.the things they carried is a brutally raw and honest insight into the experiences before, during, and after the war. this is author tim o'brien's soldier experience in vietnam. he shares the stories of the men that he knew and the ghosts that he lives with decades after his time. being raised by a canadian father that came of age during that war, my parents home library had a series by time magazine on vietnam and my dad showed my brother and i( as teenagers not as small children) some of the hollywood classics like \"platoon,\"\" full metal jacket,\" apocalypse now\" etc. so i knew that tim o'brien's recollections were not going to be cookie-cutter memories. if you read it, please understand that this book doesn't back down from the \"not so pretty \"    you can tell a true war story if it embarrasses you. if you don't care for obscenity, you don't care for the truth; if you don't care for the truth, watch how you vote. send guys to war, they come home talking dirty.  i felt most emotionally connected when tim o'brien was discussing his own ethical dilemma of heading to canada or head to war.  men killed, and died, because they were embarrassed not to. it was what had brought them to the war in the first place, nothing positive, no dreams of glory or honor, just to avoid the blush of dishonor. they died so as not to die of embarrassment.  in addition to the story , audible asked tim o'brien to read his new york times piece, \"the vietnam in me\" written in 1994 a few years after the gulf war. in it, tim o'brien is critical of some of the events in vietnam that are overlooked by american society and their history textbooks. evil has no place, it seems, in our national mythology. we erase it. we use ellipses. we salute ourselves and take pride in america the white knight, america the lone ranger, america's sleek laser-guided weaponry beating up on saddam and his legion of devils i would highly recommend the audible with bryan cranston. he was an excellent narrator.</td>\n",

       "      <td>drove out to manhattan last week to speak with my editor about a new novel (more on that soon). the trip is a rough seven hours east on i-80 and there was a lot of time to burn. i made some use of it by downloading a couple audio books over at audible, the company that did a sweet job on the man from primrose lane.i brought two books along with me. the first was defending jacob, which was a murder mystery that came highly recommended. it was well written and well told. but in the end, little more than grief porn and parental paranoia. not my thing. the other story, though, was a classic: the turn of the screw, published in 1898. and its mood and tone fit perfectly well with the new england autumn backdrop.the yarn begins the way so many good old stories do, with a character coming forth to explain why this story he’s about to tell you is the most depraved, most frightening thing you’ve ever heard. lovecraft does this a lot, this circus barking to ramp up suspense. we’ve somehow lost this over the last hundred years, with most editors and writers preferring to just get us right into the story as if they’re embarrassed to sell it too much. which is a shame, because it really does add a keen sense of suspicion.simple story, well done. a young woman applies to become the governess of two children who live on a country estate. the last governess died under mysterious circumstances and may be haunting the place. that’s about it. but the execution is lyrical, wonderful. james slowly turns the screw until the sense of dread about bly manor is palpable. and he’s daring enough to leave any real explanation to the reader. is the woman going crazy? or are the ghosts real? oh, and it packs a hell of a wallop in one last sentence.if you pick up a copy, put in on the shelf between jane eyre and rebecca. but i recommend going the audible route and heading out for a long road trip. somewhere desolate and cold.</td>\n",

3-13-56 from phillips co. 5-10yrs. rec. 3-14-56. paroled: 7-6-59.as i write this review, i'm sitting about 60 miles from the clutter house in holcomb, kansas. holcomb is a small, farming community located just west of garden city. this is a place where everyone in the whole county not only knows your name, but also has a working knowledge of your family history going back fifty plus years. i usually avoid reading true crime books. i don't want my head filled with tragedy. i want to go about my life with a degree of caution, but not be ruled by the fear i feel such books will instill. i picked up a copy of this book at the dodge city library. the librarian at the check out desk, a woman about mid-sixties, slender, elegant, and still attractive ran her finger along the edge of the spine. i noticed a shiver had rolled up her back and rippled her shoulders. she looked up at me with pinched blue eyes and said in a whisper, \"i remember when this happened\". she watched her father put locks on the doors for the first time. the murders became a demarcation line in her life there was life before the clutter murders, and then there was life after the clutter murders. her response surprised me. we live in a time when any crime anywhere in the country is broadcast out to the nation and something tragic that happens in illinois or in virginia or alaska impacts our lives. i would have thought over time some of the significance of the clutter murder would have been buried under the avalanche of murder and mayhem that the news cycle brings us 24/7. for this community and for all the small communities dotting the map of kansas, and even in the surrounding states, this was something that wasn't supposed to happen in a small town. this was big city crime that happened in their own backyard. as i talked to people about the clutter murders most everybody had some kind of physical reaction. they flinched as if they were dodging a blow or took a step back from me or developed a twitch along their jawline. their eyes gazed through me or beyond me as the fears and anxieties of 1959 came flooding back into their mind. most of them attributed more deaths to the crime, each of them citing six deaths rather than four. i'm sure they remembered that there was six family members, but two older girls had already left the home to start their own lives. they were not present on that fateful night when their family was murdered. in cold blood was required reading in many schools in this region clear up until about the 1970s, so even people who were too young to remember the crime have experienced the tragedy through truman capote. in the description above regarding perry edward smith there is a reference to phillips county. this has special significance for me because i was born and raised in phillips county. the family farm is located in phillips county. my father and i graduated from phillipsburg high school. my dad was a sophomore in high school in 1955 when perry smith decided to burglarize the chandler sales company in phillipsburg, kansas and this seemingly insignificant act was really the beginning of this story. smith and his accomplice, also smith, stole typewriters, adding machines etc and left town with their ill gotten goods in the backseat of the car. later they ignored a traffic signal in st. joseph, missouri and were pulled over by a police officer. the cop was very interested in what was in their backseat. they were extradited back to phillipsburg, where through an open window (image my embarrassment for the law enforcement of my home county) they escaped. later perry was caught again and sent back to phillipsburg where the law enforcement fortunately did a much better job of keeping track of him. perry smith received 10 years in the kansas penitentiary in leavenworth. richard eugene hickock was already serving time in leavenworth for fraud. the two met and became friends. the final piece to the puzzle that not only determined the fate of the clutter family, but also the fates of smith and hickock was snapped down in place when they meet floyd wells. wells, serving time for some bit of stupidity, had worked for herb clutter back in 1948. he told hickock and smith that clutter was a wealthy farmer, and kept a safe full of cash in his house. wells was absolutely full of shit. there was no safe. there was no pile of cash. there was absolutely no reason for four people to lose their lives for $40. \\n\\nafter the murders they went to mexico for a while, but even though they could live cheaply down south the money still trickled through their fingers. after they burned through the goods they had acquired through the clutter robbery and through defrauding a series of retail stores, they found that working in mexico didn't pay well either. they came back up to the united states and there was this baffling moment where perry smith is reading the paper and sees an article about a family that was tied up and shot to death. \"amazing!\" perry glanced through the article again. \"know what i wouldn't be surprised? if this wasn't done by a lunatic. some nut that read about what happened out in kansas.\" wtf? some nut? how about the original coconut heads that murdered the family in kansas? perry does have a moment or two where he weighs what happened in kansas. \"know what i think?\" said perry. \"i think there must be something wrong with us. to do what we did.\"\"did what?\"\"out there.\"\"deal me out, baby,\" dick said. \"i'm a normal.\"truman capote had been looking for the right story for an experimental form of writing he'd been considering trying. he wanted to blend fiction and nonfiction. the clutter murders struck him as the perfect story to launch this new form of writing. i have to admire his fortitude, for a man of his sensibilities not only spending that much time among farmbillies, but having to befriend them as well. it must have been somewhat of a painful experience. \\n\\ncapote in the clutter homefloyd wells eventually comes forward and tells what he knows about the murders. he had always liked herb clutter and felt ashamed that what he had told, in a moment of prison bonding, had led to such a vicious conclusion. without his statement i'm pretty sure that smith and hickock would have gotten away with the murders. the slender evidence tying them to the murders would have made it almost impossible to prosecute them. their sentencing can have only one conclusion...death. as they are being led back to their cells:smith says to hickock, \"no chicken-hearted jurors, they!\" they both laughed loudly, and a cameraman photographed them. the picture appeared in a kansas paper above a caption entitled: \"the last laugh?\"when i consider their bravado the last vestiges of any sympathy i may have been harboring for their plight dissipated. this is a beautifully written book. i want to thank harper lee for her role in helping capote bring this book to completion. i'm not sure capote would have had the perseverance to see it through without her holding his hand. i was surprised about how many connections i have to the events in this book many of which i had no idea until i read them in the book for the first time. i was long overdue to read this book and this experience has certainly convinced me to add more of the classic true crime genre to my reading queue. this book is legendary not only because of the heinous nature of the crime, but also because capote was ushering in a new way to tell a story. if you wish to see more

       "      <td>of life and death, verbs and nounsi expected this novel to be difficult. however, it wasn't difficult at all. it was an enormous pleasure.i was struck by the preponderance of \\nverbs\\n. the novel might happen in the head of clarissa dalloway or the other characters, but they are observing activity and their thoughts reflect it.it is more dynamic than passive or self-conscious or self-reflective.it was less a stream of consciousness, than a consciousness of life as a stream or a number of streams, rolling and tumbling and flowing in the direction of some great expanse, the ocean, an ocean of possibilities, perhaps even a party.the word \"life\" is a noun, but in my opinion, the life we live is a bundle of verbs. life is the vitality and vibrancy of the verbs we inject into it. life is what you \"do\" during the course of your time on earth. all the large and little things you do. life is eros, a life force, which can be juxtaposed in freudian terms with death (the absence of life) or thanatos.perhaps clarissa dalloway represents the vitality of eros, while her \"double\", septimus, represents thanatos.whatever, the two coexist in the novel and in each of us.how our lives turn out depends on how we accommodate their coexistence.we can let them fight or allow them to dance.\"a dance to the music of time\"ultimately, virginia woolf's novel felt to me like a dance, a progressive waltz, perhaps between life and death, eros and thanatos.it seemed to be even more worthy of the description \"a dance to the music of time\" than anthony powell's work.here is a description of the poussin painting of that name from the first novel in the sequence, \"a question of upbringing\", part of which could apply to \"mrs dalloway\":\"these classical projections, and something from the fire, suddenly suggested poussin's scene in which the seasons, hand in hand and facing outward, tread in rhythm to the notes of the lyre that the winged and naked greybeard plays. \"the image of time brought thoughts of mortality: of human beings, facing outward like the seasons, moving hand in hand in intricate measure, stepping slowly, methodically sometimes a trifle awkwardly, in evolutions that take recognisable shape: or breaking into seemingly meaningless gyrations, while partners disappear only to reappear again, once more giving pattern to the spectacle: unable to control the melody, unable, perhaps, to control the steps of the dance.\"i started to gyrate as i read on, then unable to control the melody, unable to control the steps of the dance, i grew dizzy, and slowly i started to remember something that happened a long, long time ago...the call of dutyeach long table in the dining room seated 20 people, ten aside facing each other, as you'd expect, just like the year before, only now there would be some faces gone and some new faces expected, you wouldn’t really know who until everybody had returned from the end of term vacation and taken their position, some sitting in the same place, some moving to fill the gaps, some leaving a space to be filled by someone new.there were a dozen or so at their usual table by the time ian arrived for dinner, he looked up and down the table, until he saw six familiar faces, a hint of recognition on his face, his friends were all towards one end of the table, away from the front doors, although nobody occupied the two end seats, they had been left for latecomers.to the left of his friends, a group of first year students were sitting in the middle of the table, not yet known or identified by names, so ian pulled out a seat at the end of the table and prepared to sit down, gently lifting his chair so as not to make a sound and disturb the conversation that was in progress, chatter, chatter, talk, talk, this is what i did on my holidays, keith had obtained work as a legal clerk, ginny had spent the whole time at her parents’ beach house on the south coast, becky had returned to switzerland and worked in a strawberry jam factory, making tiny woodchips that were supposed to replace the seeds that dissolved in the acidic process of making the jam.an olive, almost dark, complexioned woman walked up and asked if she could sit on the chair opposite ian, he nodded yes, not knowing who she was or whether she already knew his friends, she had not been in college last year, while everybody else reacted enthusiastically, yes, sure, of course, thanks for joining us, judy, becky said, have you met everybody here, this is ian, she said, i’ve heard so much about this ian, judy replied with a smile, in her eastern european accent, he couldn’t work out where it was from, though it was not as guttural as german, he stood and shook judy’s hand, almost chivalrously, although there was no need for chivalry yet, at least, nothing to be chivalrous about, these days, apart of course from the presence of this charming woman, which was more than enough, but ian was already smiling, he liked this new judy.she answered ian’s many eager questions politely, until finally he had ascertained that she was hungarian, and that her father was the hungarian ambassador, from communist hungary, as it was then, she was moving into college for her second last year while she worked on her honours thesis in french literature and wanted to be closer to the french department and away from the temptations of diplomatic parties and constant socializing, as if college life would be any less demanding, even though she loved that life, she was diligent in her studies, she wanted to be a writer, a publisher or a diplomat herself, and ian had found all of this out while he deftly worked away at his roast lamb and three vegetables, it was a sunday night before the first day of the new term, and there was always a roast of some sort.some of their friends finished their meals and left during the conversation, though ian continually brought the chit chat back to judy, as if they were the only ones present, you could tell he was infatuated already, well, becky could, she was more alert to these things, her father was the australian ambassador to switzerland, it wasn’t a big deal, switzerland was only a small country anyway, it wasn’t even discussed amongst their friends, but they had nevertheless gravitated towards each other, informally forming a group of diplomatic children, ian being the odd one out, the son of a banker, though his ambition was to be a diplomat, and if unsuccessful in that ambition, to at least get a few foreign affairs under his belt, he had a taste for the exotic, almost as if he was seeking a life raft upon which to escape from the routine life that awaited him in australia in those days.judy was the first one of the remaining group to rise from the table, but as she did so, she reached into her handbag and took out four small envelopes, they contained invitations, each of them inscribed with someone’s name in neat blue fountain pen, though not the script that was familiar to australians at the time, even her writing was exotic, she gave three to ian’s remaining friends, and then, looking ian in the eyes, handed him one, too, i would be delighted if you would come to my room for drinks on tuesday night, any time between 8 and 11, ian looked at the envelope and saw that it already bore his name, ian graye, he still has that envelope somewhere, with his other love letters and curios, judy said, i knew i would meet you sooner or later, so i took the liberty of making out an invitation for you, what if you hadn’t liked me, he asked, well, in that case, i would have wasted an envelope and some writing paper, she said, not a great loss, but i didn’t think there was much chance of that.no sooner were the envelopes circulated than judy left to return to her room, ian rising almost immediately afterwards, looking at his watch and saying, well, duty calls, becky spotted the glint in his eye and laughed, you mean, judy calls, and she laughed again, as if she had just read his fortune in a teacup.the next two days, ian didn’t see judy or becky or keith or virginia, because other friends saw him enter the dining room and asked him to join them, each time introducing him to first year students that they had just met, so tuesday night came around quickly, although first he had to have some drinks in the union bar with some other students from his political science class, he had intended to finish up around 10pm and return to college for the last hour of the party, but it was 10:30 when he looked at his watch and realised he was going to be late, it was totally dark when he got outside, there was no moon and the stars were obscured by clouds, he walked quickly, anxiously, embarrassed, the crushed granite surface of the footpath crunching underfoot, his heart started to beat faster and a droplet of sweat formed on his temple, he was almost out of breath by the time he arrived at judy’s door, giving the impression that he had hurried to be there, even though he was close to three hours late and had nearly, rudely, missed the party altogether, still as

       "      <td>i’m so glad my virginia woolf cherry has popped. it was starting to become shameful. during conversations, upon hearing that i didn’t have a fave vw novel and that in fact i’d never read her, my friends would react with shock—shock i tell you—and then a kind of embarrassed-for-asking dismay. me, of all people, not to have bonded in my adolescence with this iconoclastic, feminist literary icon! some may even have considered whisking me away to some seedy little biblioteque on the outskirts of town, where under the gentle guidance of a patient librarian i could, you know, peruse the “w” shelf more thoroughly.i think now there has been some sort of divine plan in my reluctance to dip my toes in woolf’s stream of consciousness. it strikes me that mrs. dalloway is—among many other things — a novel that speaks poignantly and eloquently to the middle-aged among us. but then, as jo and i have been discussing here, maybe i just would have read a different story in it had i read it earlier, or seen a different set of images through the kaleidoscopic lenses of woolf’s characters.i didn’t identify with clarissa as much as i recognized her; she is a woman not only of her time, but of mine (and maybe yours). she is a certain type of woman who exists in every generation, perhaps. clarissa is the epitome of the materially-wealthy but spiritually and emotionally disillusioned baby boomer: the idealism and passion of her youth has now faded, her self-identity, wrapped up in her role as wife, mother, hostess-with-the-mostest, has become unfulfilling. her débutante daughter (her surrogate self) has taken up with a religious freak. her husband lunches with a woman she perceives as more powerful and competent than she (and who can’t resist telling her that she’s the cause of her husband’s stalled political career; although woolf is also careful to show lady bruton as a puffed-up, self-important dowager—a dying breed, along with hugh whitbread, along with the entire british aristocracy—whose political maneuverings are clumsy and ultimately, likely, ineffectual). richard brings clarissa flowers as proof of his love, but they don’t talk—or sleep—together anymore.like a nun withdrawing, or a child exploring a tower, [clarissa:] went, upstairs, paused at the window…. there was an emptiness about the heart of life; an attic room. …the sheets were clean, tight stretched in abroad white band from side to side. narrower and narrower would her bed be. …for the house sat so long that richard insisted, after her illness, that she must sleep undisturbed…. so the room was an attic; the bed narrow; and lying there reading, for she slept badly, she could not dispel a virginity preserved through childbirth which clung to her like a sheet. (p 23)and did they ever really communicate, or is this a marriage, if not of convenience, of expectation? an upwardly mobile politician with good prospects; he seemed like the right choice at the time. but, here is peter: the one that got away. clarissa simultaneously regrets and rationalizes her decision to let him go. he is flighty, lacks a seriousness of purpose, a scholar and writer who hasn’t lived up to his potential, has botched one marriage and is now involved in a second complicated entanglement that doesn’t bode well and to which he is not committed (all because he can’t let go of clarissa). and now, he’s back in london and hoping richard can arrange a job for him. each of these characters – clarissa, richard, peter – is having a mid-life crisis like any self-respecting baby boomer does. each — and their country! — is at a cross-roads. the times they are a-changin’, but before they do, there’s an anxious, stagnant vacuum in the zeitgeist that none of them, no matter how clever their rationalizations, light-hearted their chatter, or perfect their party, can fill.peter and clarissa are two sides of the same coin; she would have been him had she not married well. he is her past (and she is his): romanticized, on the brink of seemingly infinite possibilities at the time, but gone. it is her past she mourns, the self she should have become; and her present — the self she did become — she struggles to make sense of. the time she thought she had to become who she thought she would be has passed. she can’t fully admit this, because to do so would mean acknowledging the emptiness and meaninglessness of her life. so instead, she throws parties. every flight of fancy, every enthusiasm and exuberance in which she professes to love life, is surrounded by death or some kind of emptiness. i perceive clarissa’s adamant insistence that life is wonderful and her manic frenzied outbursts as overcompensation for her true state of mind and her intuition, which she skitters around and never raises to full consciousness, that her life is, rather, one of emptiness and isolation. and let’s talk about richard, clarissa’s slightly shadowy husband. yet another character who’s come to a certain age and is facing the realization that this is as far as he’ll go, this is it. a practical man, though: he doesn’t appear to think too much about it, but rather accepts his lot and gets on with it. only through other lenses (clarissa’s, peter’s, lady bruton’s) do we see him clearly.but that is true of all of them, isn’t it? and this is woolf’s genius. the chatter, the gossip, the endless speculation and self-examinations never penetrate the real meaning of things. they, and particularly clarissa, see, think, feel but do they ever truly understand? certainly not their own characters, and only partially those of others. and how well do they interpret? are they even accurate reporters? my sense is no. not only do they misinterpret, but they see only the surface.(there is an interesting commentary here on consciousness and especially the subconscious. for her thorough, and no doubt justified dislike of psychiatry, woolf must have known of freud and jung; she is exploring consciousness and unconscious motives here — especially clarissa’s.)woolf is saying that none of us ever see the truth of our own situations, and also that we can’t know the truth about others’. we see, feel, experience and interpret the world through our own lens—one lens—and we are seen, felt, experienced and interpreted by other individuals through theirs. only in the aggregate, by putting them all together and triangulating them, can we get a glimpse of the real meaning (in this case, the reader becomes the omniscient one). meaning is a slippery changeling; at any moment, it can slip away in the same way, perhaps, as one’s reason can.and now to septimus: why does woolf give us septimus? in addition to being a commentary on the tragic state of psychiatry, the ignorance around mental illness of the time (which of course woolf knew all too well), the folly of the cures and the hypocritical and harmful “healers,” septimus is the classic foil: he shows us insanity (oh, and how well does woolf write it!) so that we can recognize how fragile sanity is; how much a matter of perception, how relative it is, and how thin the line between reason and lack of it. he is also death, in contrast to clarissa’s life.  i cannot help but feel that all of these characters — including septimus — are different aspects of one larger character. they exist as a kind of ‘collective unconscious’ and, in that, are emblematic of their society. for the entire country is in transition, and that topic threads through the text: what is britain to do about india; and what is to become of the stodgy old lords and ladies, dangerously, bumblingly incompetent but still in power? the old must give way to the new, both in personal and political life. the war, like clarissa’s influenza, may be over, but what’s left is a country and a way of life that is dead. even though woolf doesn’t show us, directly, any agents of change within mrs dalloway, she does show us a world, and the people in it, who will be casualties of it.**************************************i reserve the right to alter or even completely delete and rewrite this review as conversation ensues in virginia woolf's library!!

       "      <td>i am specifically reviewing the illustrated, unabridged unicorn edition of peter pan, published in 1987, isbn 0881010693. in 1990, my grandparents sent me unicorn editions of robin hood, pinocchio, and a christmas carol. all three books are clothbound, with embossed gold lettering on the covers and spine that, almost 20 years later, are only beginning to fade. the books are large, unabridged, and heavy: each book in the unicorn series is over a foot long, almost too tall to shelve comfortably in a child's bookcase.to clear up any confusion, let me mention there were smaller, shorter editions, also, published under the \"little unicorn\" imprint. i have eight of them--there may be as many as nineteen in all--all eight purchased all at once, suddenly and cheaply, by my great-uncle, from a sam's club book bin in maybe the late 80s. the little unicorn illustrated classics are all abridged for young readers; to an adult, they're only vignettes, synopses typed out in large set. \"sized for small hands,\" the back of each book reads, \"this high quality, hardcover book is a valuable addition to every child's library.\"half of my little unicorn collection is in very nice condition, but on peter pan, twenty thousand leagues, and antique fairy tales, the laminate is blistering and, in pan's case, peeling away from the book cover.both the unicorn and little unicorn editions of peter pan were illustrated by greg hildebrandt. like the other full-size unicorn books, this particular hardcover volume is clothbound in bright green fabric. it's a bold emerald color, brighter than unicorn's a christmas carol forest-green fabric (also illustrated by hildebrandt, a variation on his original 1983 simon and schuster illustrations). peter pan's green cover seems especially stark next to the stodgier brown and maroon of, respectively, the covers of pinocchio and robin hood (both illustrated, also, by hildebrandt).i used to very carefully examine peter pan's illustrations during church--the little unicorn edition could be hidden, somewhat, in the cleavage of a thick open bible. in the years since, i have actively hated every other illustrated version of peter pan. my complaints are legion: the pan is a freckle-faced child with zero sex appeal; he is a devil-faced disney imp; he is obviously based on mary martin. he is always too young or too old, too victorian or too modern. some illustrator always forgets his titular pan-pipes, strung on a lace about his neck.of course, as barrie reminds us, the topography of neverland itself is the literal depiction of a child's mind, a dynamic dream. so no illustrator can get it quite right.this brings me to a strange admission: when i was a kid, i took the little unicorn edition of peter pan to school, where i insisted to classmates that the paintings inside were not only portraits of real people, but in fact, painted from actual photographs taken inside neverland. it was only a game, but i was very convincing: i insisted, as if it were really really really true.i'm not sure why i admitted this to my best childhood friend today. i was embarrassed when i told her. i described what seems now a blithely malicious act.\"did anyone fall for it?\" she wanted to know. she'd just given me the unabridged unicorn edition of peter pan, today, an unexpected gift.\"one person did,\" i nodded.\"i might have, too,\" she said. \"i was really gullible.\"but in retrospect, hildebrandt's paintings for pinocchio and the others have aged better than peter pan's illustrations. the others are, each in its own way, period pieces; the victorian and renaissance eras are all muddled browns and stiff staging.peter pan, though, is a different creature. its anti-hero is a dimpled preteen boy with strong, brown arms, feathered brown hair, and a leafy diaper. tinker bell, with her wild shock of platinum hair, is a leggy strumpet; her toes are always pointed like a ballerina. tiger lily, the brave piccaninnie princess, is a long, lean woman in a leather bikini top (incidentally, her portraits are based on one heidi corso, who was at that time unicorn publishing's associate editor).the illustrations that captivated me most in the 80s are the ones that, in 2009, seem most dated. in the fifth plate, \"the magic shores of neverland,\" peter and the children are airborne, and peter gestures down toward the islands below that, in the pink fire of morning, look pastel-purpley. without the victorian children in their nightgowns, the scene could be the backdrop for one of those realistic fantasy paintings of dolphins, the kind you used to find on a trapper keeper.in plate 16, \"the mermaids' lagoon,\" the women, swatting at bubbles, all wear long, wild hair: red, blonde, blue, purple. their lavender fish scales glint gold in the light, a painterly suggestion of iridescence, a photorealistic lisa frank visage.now, as an adult, my favorite images are muted browns, impervious to the passage of time. they usually involve the story's central and most villainous grown-up, captain hook. in the plate \"the elegant captain hook,\" wendy takes hold of the pirate's enormous hook as he escorts her out of her house. this painting is confusing because hook is, in actuality, kidnapping wendy. but he is charmed when he sees wendy for the first time, and in spite of his nefarious intentions, he extends his hook toward her. she is equally startled, and in spite of her understandable terror, she accepts, her tiny hand wrapping around the cold black metal.in an earlier plate, hildebrandt's \"the arch-enemies meet,\" hook faces peter, and there is some sort of brown grey granite between them. peter is grinning sadistically, while captain hook appears to be gnashing his teeth. the painting is, by any child's measure of aesthetics, completely uninteresting.here is what is happening, though, if memory serves: hook and peter are in a stand-off of sorts, and at the same time, both are trying to keep hold of the same slippery rock in the sea. for peter, this is just a game. but when hook begins to slip off the rock, peter grabs hold of his arm, hoisting hook back up to his level. in that moment of vulnerability, the pirate plunges his enormous hook the fleshy space between peter's rib and hip.what follows is what matters: peter is horrified. more importantly, hook has broken his heart. hook means murder. he is that abomination of real life: he is a grown person who would willingly hurt a child.what peter doesn't realize, though, is that this all has happened before. each time the two face off, hook plunges his missing hand into peter's side, and each time, peter's heart is broken anew. hook remembers all of this, certainly, but peter is condemned to repeat this scene's action again and again. because, if a child were never to grow up, it means he'd never make new memories. peter's innocence relies entirely on his inability to learn from experience.what so few illustrators are able to emphasize is that peter pan, the book, is a victorian horror story, with peter cast as the story's real monster. his anger lasts only a moment; his childlike love lacks depth or meaning. even in spite of her best, tinker bell--too small, someone explains, to hold more than one pure feeling inside of her at once--tries to have wendy killed.small surprise, then, that peter is too undisciplined to return for wendy in the coming years, or he simply doesn't care enough. when he does come to her window to take her away, she has to explain, in the dark, that she can't accompany him anymore. then wendy suddenly stands to turn on the light. and although barrie assures us, in a writerly flittering, that wendy did bloom into a beautiful, tall young woman, the vocabulary here is distinctly that of horror. peter recoils as wendy's terrible, grown form rises from its chair, and he screams out when the light comes on, when he sees how changed she is.his sense of loss is fleeting, however, because he immediately turns his attention to wendy's daughter. wendy tries to stop him, but he has already taken her.plate 30 is the last plate in the book. it is titled \"when wendy grew up,\" and it is black and white and grey, a pencil drawing. in it, wendy stares out the window after her own daughter, and at peter, whose silhouettes have rapidly narrowed into tiny moonlit sylphs. both have already forgotten her.it's a complicated picture to abandon a child with, because it is a very muted picture. it is essentially a pencil drawing of aching.hildebrandt--that painter of glimmering wings and floating pastel bubbles--bravely disappoints children with the final plate. it's the most important, though, so apt a rendering is it of the grown-up melancholy that besets those childlike flourishes of grief. the emotion is complicated and ponderous, too large for any tinker bell to contain. i assume that it's the sort of illustration mr. barrie, the author, himself intended.the plate accompanies this text, which in turn concludes the novel:\"of course in the end wendy let them fly away together. our last glimpse of her shows her at the window, watching them receding into the sky until they were as small as stars.\"as you look at wendy you may see her hair becoming white, and her figure little again, for all this happened long ago. jane is now a common grown-up, with a daughter called margaret; and every spring-cleaning time, except when he forgets, peter comes for margaret and takes her to the neverland, where she tells him stories about himself, to which he listens eagerly.\"when margaret grows up she will have a daughter, who is to be peter's mother in turn; and so it will go on, so long as children are gay and innocent and heartless.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>far cleverer people than me have reviewed and critiqued this book, with far more intelligence and insight into political theory than i could ever have. so i’m not going to embarrass myself by even trying. instead, i’m just going to give a general overview of what i thought about my book. those who are looking for an intense academic conversation, probably better to look at other reviews. apologies. :)well then, the review. personally, it was really interesting for me to know that the book was dedicated to lorenzo de’ medici. as an amateur school-level historian i’ve taken an immense amount of interest the medici as historical figures, so it was amazing for me to read something that it’s quite possible one of them may have read. of course, it’s equally possible that he didn’t, but even were that the case, it was still fascinating to read such a renowned book, from such a renowned author, written during my favourite period of history – the renaissance.a lot of people have probably described machiavelli and his work the prince as “evil”. and you can probably see why, after you’ve read it, and especially considering that people like hitler claim to have studied the prince. but i read it, and i turned out okay. i think…for a long time now i’ve been hearing the word “machiavellian”… people spitting out the word as if it’s supposed to be a bad thing, or pulling it out of the ether with a slightly superior air, as if to say “well yes, i know all about machiavellian, i’ve read the prince.” needless to say, part of my reading the prince was to be able to lay claim to that same superiority, even if i never have the nerve to use it. but the other reason was that i had no idea what people were talking about. they said he was cunning, and really i couldn’t see that as such a bad thing. from the small amount that i knew of machiavelli, i just could not understand why on earth you’d want to stay away from being identified with him, and now i know why.it’s not because machiavelli is immoral, not at all. no, it’s because machiavelli almost completely ignores ethics in light of attempting to achieve his goal – recommending the best ways for princes to stay in power. and, bloody hell, you just can’t argue with the bastard. his method of argument was something i found both fascinating and scary. fascinating because it’s all logical and faultless, and he uses many classic examples to show the reader how different famous military leaders went wrong. and to be honest, it’s not like machiavelli is standing there prancing up and down going; “hey! people! come on, it’s fun to be a crafty immoral bastard who kills loads of people.” he’s just being matter-of-fact, rather saying; “hey, well, you said you wanted to be a prince. sorry, dude, but sometimes that means killing people who annoy you. or rather, people who need to die so you can stay where you want to be. so, yeah, people who annoy you.” sometimes in fact he essentially encourages ethics and morals, acknowledging the fact that if you’re an evil bastard all the time you are never going to get anywhere, because no-one at all will like you. you’ve just got to learn how to be morally correct and nice to the right people. so, no, machiavelli was not completely immoral. but i think what scares people is his utter lack of recognition of people as human beings. and what if people get in the way of your ultimate goal? well, that’s just too bad for them. and it truly was chilling, sometimes; to read the almost careless, cold way that machiavelli talks of people.that was pretty much my overall idea of the prince. it’s a fascinating book for anyone interested in political history, and for anyone who has ever heard of the infamous machiavelli. besides that it’s incredibly interesting for anyone who, does, well, want to take over the world. good luck with that, guys. if my judgement is any indication, you’ll need this book. you’ll never get anywhere without it.</td>\n",

emotions that by no stretch or artifice could be properly coated and covered by her own resources.novelist carol shields observes that austen's aesthetic minimalism and ideological idealism are so rigorous that there are no fingers and toes in her fiction—and just as austen's relative silence about slavery is redacted by patricia rozema's 1999 mansfield park film, so joe wright corrects her digital deficit in his 2005 pride and prejudice adaptation, whose lizzy bennet goes barefoot almost enough to satisfy quentin tarantino—and that's without mentioning the porcine testicles wright notoriously also includes in the film, which is perhaps not what charlotte brontë meant when she criticized the lack of \"open country\" in austen.while our flaubert-and-hemingway-conditioned contemporary mfa idea of \"the literary\" is saturated in very non-austenian physical concreteness, as one computational humanist reveals, jane austen is otherwise our ancestor in her political silences. our novels may have fingers galore, but still not too many napoleons. when madeline ffitch complains in this vein about \"neoliberal realism\" (\"[m]arked by formal unity, the quest for authenticity, and the belief that the self is a 'bottomless pool' full of cogent meaning and redemption\"), she could be describing the flexibly conservative national agenda of austen's regency-era domestic novels just as well.realistic literary fiction after austen still tends to command an inside perspective on the world, where inside refers both to the cultural interiors of the (broadly) middle-class household and to the psychic interiors of its personae. austen invented the modern realist novel, and nowhere more than in emma, because she innovates upon 18th-century realism's cumbersome epistolary structures or mock-epic storytellers by introducing a subtle, supple, impersonal third-person narrator that spends half its time in its heroines' heads.the fiction-writing device that externalizes this interior life is free indirect discourse: a third-person narrative rhetoric that blends with the inner language of the character whose viewpoint it takes up. unlike first-person narrative, free indirect discourse communicates what a character could or would never consciously say for herself, but unlike third-person objective narration, it insists on miming or dramatizing her inner life rather than merely reporting on it. because it limits information to what one character at a time can know—or even one character per novel if the viewpoint is limited to the protagonist, as it mostly is in emma—free indirect discourse is also useful for creating suspense, since readers must discover the secrets of the plot alongside the often blinkered protagonist. as adela pinch notes in the introduction to the oxford world classics edition of emma:austen makes voices stick in the mind through her use of free indirect discourse, which makes a character's voice seem indelible, capable of soaking into other beings. but she also uses the same technique for representing thought. her cultivation of this mode of representing her heroines' minds has made her novels crucial to the history of the english novel, markers of a moment when the novel as a literary genre perfects its inward turn, and begins to claim human psychology as its territory.in emma, austen exploits both the ideological and aesthetic potential of this narrative form beautifully. the eponymous heroine seems to have it all—at 21, she is \"handsome, clever, and rich,\" the opening sentence famously informs us—but what she lacks is an understanding of the social structure she inhabits and the people who share it with her. how better to tell such a tale of inner transformation than from the inside out?the plot begins with a transformation of emma's estate, hartfield, in the small but london-adjacent town of highbury. after the early death of emma's mother, she was partially reared by her governess, miss taylor. but miss taylor has married; now mrs. weston, she has moved to a nearby estate called randalls, leaving emma alone with her gentle, hypochondriacal father. for his part, mr. woodhouse disapproves of marriage because it breaks up families—and emma accordingly resolves not to wed, especially since she, unlike lizzy bennet or fanny price, has no economic imperative to do so.instead of seeking to get married herself, the bored emma wants to marry off others. at the beginning of the novel, she takes up the cause of harriet smith, a boarding-school orphan of uncertain parentage. she declares harriet's first suitor—a local farmer who works on the estate of emma's single brother-in-law, mr. knightley—to be, as a yeoman, too middling to catch her fancy, unlike the graceful gentry or the picturesque poor. despite the likelihood that harriet herself also lacks pedigree, emma encourages her to reject martin.emma tries to fix harriet up with the new vicar, mr. elton, who mistakes emma's attentions to him on behalf of harriet as indicating the rich young woman's own attraction. excited by the possibility of his marrying up into one of highbury's most prominent families, mr. elton proposes to emma during a carriage ride, and is insulted to learn that she'd thought him drawn to the obscure harriet.while emma is chastened by this blunder, which occupies the first third of the novel, she immediately falls into another. mr. weston's flashy son, frank churchill, who has been reared by the aristocratic family of his deceased mother, comes to town. emma, though not quite as attracted to him as the town thinks she should be, falls into a flirtation with the witty if vain young man (he goes all the way to london for a haircut)—a flirtation at the expense of the mysteriously reserved jane fairfax.jane is another orphan, niece to emma's friend miss bates, a prolix and shabby-genteel vicar's daughter. emma plainly envies the lower-born but equally beautiful and occasionally more accomplished jane, which motivates her confederacy with frank to gossip about and even humiliate the diffident young woman, even though jane, unlike emma, is condemned to serve out the rest of her days as a governess rather than as wealthy mistress of a distinguished family estate.i will let first-time readers discover how this central thread of the plot ravels itself out through the novel's last two-thirds, but suffice to say that emma has again mistaken both the motives of those around her and her own drives and desires. ruled by vanity and an overactive imagination rather than by reason, she neglects her twofold duty: 1. to treat the less fortunate, like jane and miss bates, with kindness and forbearance; 2. not to upset the social hierarchy of the rural gentry, as in her attempt to marry harriet to mr. elton, which only leaves everyone upset and embarrassed, and results in the creation of vain monstrosities like mr. elton's eventual wife, a conceited and tasteless parvenu who is the second half of the novel's mortifying comic relief.perhaps the best way not to interfere with highbury's hierarchy is for emma to marry within her own elite class. this is where her brother-in-law mr. knightley comes in. to contemporary readers, he is an unlikely beau for emma. he is an old family friend, 16 years her senior, and he has, he confides to her, \"'been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least.'\" he also lectures more than flirts with her (\"'i cannot see you acting wrong, without a remonstrance'\"), unlike the immediately appealing if callow frank churchill, though the novel validates knightley's lectures by having the plot always prove them factually and morally correct, in contrast to emma's constant misprisions. churchill might be emma's male doppelgänger (\"'i think there is a little likeness between us,'\" he says at the close), but for that very reason could never be her partner, even if austen did not seem to think his vivacity unseemly and effeminate in a man.and knightley is the master of nearby donwell abbey, and the magistrate and defender of the whole neighborhood, suddenly beset as it is in the novel's second half with \"gypsies\" and thieves. he is, moreover, one of the only men mr. woodhouse might consent to marrying his daughter. we might even say that mr. woodhouse's ineffectual and unmanly hypochondria necessitates that another man, a real man, step in and rule hartfield. if the novel begins with the loss to marriage of emma's surrogate mother, it ends with her gaining, through marriage, a new and improved father.as for emma, her problem is that she represents a new way of thinking in england: recklessly imaginative and heedless of old divisions and hierarchies. she is particularly concerned to transform the economic into the aesthetic, as we see when she is offended by the idea that money-and-class concerns could intrude on true love and its emotive, aesthetic regard for the inner quality of persons:[b]ut then, mr. knightley did not make due allowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives. mr. knightley saw no such passion, and of course thought nothing of its effects; but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest; and more than a reasonable, becoming degree of prudence, s...</td>\n",

       "      <td>emma is one of those classic novels that may not grab the reader immediately from the first sentence. in fact, it took me a while to figure out who many of the characters were, and i had to go back and find out how the characters were all related. at times i felt like i was figuring out a complex equation. but soon enough, i became interested in what appeared to be trivial conversations between the characters, namely emma and her father, but once again, like in many of jane austen’s novels, i realised that what appeared like a trivial conversation was a clever way of introducing different aspects of each character, and the added sarcasm always revealed how the author perhaps, felt about society at the time. after all, to understand where the author is coming from, we need to understand the era when the novels were written, and how people would fuss about things that may not seem as important now, in this case, the georgian period. the protagonist is emma, a young woman who is comfortably set in society, as she has quite a large fortune and she feels no need to ever get married. she lives with her father who rarely ventures off to places far away from highbury, and offers his opinion to anyone who does. he likes his comforts and believes everyone feels the same as he does. emma however, is more clever than he is — even if she irresponsibly takes it upon herself to play match-maker with her new friend, harriet, and others, we do see her contemplating things from other people’s perspectives many times. even though she thinks she is right in many matters, we do see her inwardly questioning some of her decisions.for the above reasons, i don’t think that emma is as obnoxious as we may assume when we are first introduced to the character. it is irresponsible of her to misguide harriet, especially when mr martin obviously loves harriet, and she too loves him deep down. emma convinces her that they are not a suitable match, and believes he is beneath her in society even if no-one knows who harriet’s parents are and mr martin is a lot more established than she is financially. however, emma does feel guilt at times, especially when mr knightley, her friend, questions her decisions, so we see that there is room for the character to show compassion and see things from someone else’s perspective. in contrast her father refuses to believe that the seaside can be good for one’s health and we see him arguing with the decision his daughter, isabella, and her husband had made to holiday at the seaside with their children on doctor’s orders. he is a character that although is portrayed as being kind and caring, is in fact obnoxious or extremely naive. we see emma trying to keep the peace on many occasions, and being embarrassed by her father’s remarks. emma can seem like an unlikely character for a jane austen novel, but it’s never so black and white; there are many layers to the character. i think in life all types of people should be given a chance to see what else they have to offer, and jane austen, i think, understood that — not every person is what they always appear to be. she demonstrates this in many of her novels, and i was, once again, amazed by the author’s ability to reveal so many human characteristics that ring true with people even in today’s setting. for example, emma’s dislike for one of the characters, jane fairfax. in one scene she emphasises that the more jane’s aunt boasted about jane, the more emma’s dislike towards jane grew, even if jane herself was reserved. i found myself nodding at many such examples. the novel slowly becomes more interesting when the character of frank churchill and jane are thrown in the mix. the novel then unravels and many revelations are revealed. it is rather long and it took me a while to read it, but that is due to the fact that i felt like i had to study every sentence, as the writing is so rich and insightful. i felt that i would miss something important in even the most seemingly trivial of conversations. in today’s world many don’t have the time to sit without interruptions and really savour each word and contemplate what it means. it emphasises how life has changed, and that the things that constituted excellent writing have changed immensely. i am sure that in today’s era if this novel was published, it would be labelled as an over-written rom com because our modern world doesn’t really invite us to sit down and think — really think — well, that’s what i think anyway.it was an extremely well-written, delightful and entertaining novel. even though it took me a while to get into the story, i wanted to keep reading and see how the characters evolve. i think jane austen was a woman ahead of her time and saw things about society that others refused to see or were too caught up in following its expectations to care.</td>\n",

so what other austen novels do you plan on reading? me: none, really. i, uh, don't really like her bookssecond party: why not?me:  *shrugs shoulders* just not my cup of tea, i guess.\\ni would like to disclose in this review once and for all that i could never consider myself a jane austen fan. i know that she's an amazing, influential classical female writer whose works have been adapted on screen and translated worldwide. i also always nod in amicable agreement whenever someone mentions her as their favorite author because i can acknowledge her contributions to literature as well as respect the fact that you enjoy her works. that being said, austen is simply not the kind of writer whom i can connect with. i tried finding a semblance of kinship in her works several times in the past with pride and sense, two novels which i hadn't finished for the first two times i read them, but i only did so by the third and fourth time respectively.simply put, i don't like jane austen's books even if she is an immensely celebrated writer. i find her prose often tedious even if she can compose passages with wit and humor. i think her characters are intolerable and the only redeeming quality i admire about her characterizations is that she obviously isn't afraid to make her protagonists unlikable and absurd which is where the source of her rich social comedy of manners sprout from.for the longest time i told myself i will never read another austen novel again but because i was so irrevocably smitten with the pemberly digital webseries \\n\\n    emma approved\\n  \\nwhich is the modernized adaptation of this novel, i decided to venture on, reassuring myself that perhaps third's time the charm. in a few inspired ways, it was.but in many other instances that's almost painful, it wasn't.emma  is supposed to be a story about 'youthful hubris and misconstrued romance' and with austen's signature dry humor and amusing observations and parody regarding the exhausting social graces during the era she is writing in, emma  more than fulfills that promising premise. the titular heroine emma woodhouse is beautiful, clever and rich but she's also conceited and proud; often overestimating her so-called \"matchmaking\" skills. she's only twenty-one and a privileged one at that who has a very high opinion of herself and how others should view her. in spite of these flaws, emma can be impressive particularly because of her streak of independence and ideas about a woman's agency which were considered queer and upsetting during her time. because she has no financial hardships unlike other austen heroines, emma does not feel obligated to get married.in fact, as an heiress, she would rather just live by herself in her estate and possibly throw cool parties and hang out with other legible ladies whom she can charm and bewitch. one of them who has fallen prey to emma's irresistible companionship is the modest harriet smith who eagerly tries to please emma by following every single advice the other woman gives even if ultimately it proves to be to her detriment. their friendship is not exactly of equals which make their interactions quite infectiously funny and warm at times. i have no doubt emma adores harriet but she tends to confuse that with her incessant need to control harriet's choices for her which had proved to be bothersome. emma's heart is in the right place but she's also far too headstrong to realize that her actions often cause harm or misunderstanding to the people around her. but austen has written the approach to this relationship as a little bit of a comedy so at least that breaks the tension a bit.the main conflict that happened in the first volume (this novel is divided into four, or whatever, i'm too lazy to check the book again) is emma's adamant belief that a certain mr. elton fancies her friend harriet. emma was so convinced that she is doing something remarkable and worthwhile by matchmaking these two that she was totally blind-sighted by the fact that mr. elton actually wants emma and not harriet. it was only when mr. elton himself confessed that emma realized that she was wrong to make assumptions from evidence that she willfully and purposefully interpreted for her own convenience and in support of her own twisted logic. not only did she embarrass and humiliate harriet and mr. elton by placing them in a very awkward position concerning misread signals and feelings, she has also deliberately cast aside harriet's suitor robert who seemed to like harriet enough and sincerely wanted to be a good husband to her, if she will have him. to emma, however, harriet should aspire for more. not a bad sentiment; in fact it's the kind of liberal thinking ahead of her time--but it's not something accepted by society back then so poor harriet will only suffer humiliation to her character, all because emma wants to put her in equal footing as herself which is ridiculous! harriet is nice and sweet but she can't have the same set of choices and freedom as emma because emma has the privilege to be fickle, vain and independent--harriet simply does not. emma's ignorance over such an obvious difference between their social standing is irritating--yet also very endearing.emma being emmaemma does not care that people in her social circle would see harriet as beneath them; she adores harriet nevertheless because she finds her interesting and special and whether or not she realizes it can be a tad condescending is unimportant because emma only has good intentions even if those intentions get her into troubles of her own silly making. i think emma is very well-written, filled with enough flaws and entitlement that give her much depth as the protagonist. another aspect of her character that i had fun exploring was when it comes to her opinions and insights regarding the lovely jane fairfax. emma is insecure around jane, mostly because jane is reserved and hard to engage in small talk, as well as the very definition of an accomplished woman that emma aspires to be. while emma is merely content indulging on her whims for so-called self-improvement and autonomy outside marriage, jane fairfax dedicates herself to fulfilling work outside the confines of her social class which makes her more learned, resourceful and educated about the world. the only thing that emma comforts herself with when it comes to jane fairfax is that jane is actually pretty dull in personality, often the subject of light mockery between emma and the slightly douche-y frank churchill. in one conversation, they talk about how boring jane is and that people like emma and frank are not to blame if they can't find the energy or time to try and coax jane out of her shell. both so arrogant, self-assured and individualistic, emma and frank for me are the perfect match.however, emma has claimed since the beginning of this book that she has never fallen in love and could never be capable of it hence her aversion towards marriage. i could easily surmise that she could have been an asexual which would be okay but i don't think austen ever intended her to be that which would have been more of a rewarding character twist, to be honest. it's worth nothing that even though emma does not want to involve herself in personal romantic entanglements, she is more than happy to insert herself in other people's love lives. austen plays this absurd character flaw of hers to a tee and i can admit that they are the instances in this novel that i find very enjoyable to peruse. it's the source of this book's conflicts. that being said, almost a good sixty percent of this four-hundred-seventy-seven-paged book is so fucking slow and repetitive. i even said during one of my status updates for my reading progress that the social interactions among characters that populate this book are the victorian-equivalent of facebook-ing. the content of these scenes and dialogue does not at all justify the length and i hated every goddamn minute i have to read through all the non-events that happened by the 180-paged mark. nothing monumental truly transpires after the amusing mr. elton-harriet-emma drama save for the scarce intriguing narrations concerning jane fairfax being a bore to emma (and emma feeling guilty about feeling that way), and emma's contemplation about her real feelings for frank; and whether or not she's attracted to him or not.emma does not end up with frank churchill, though. she ends up with mr. knightly, an old family friend who is ten or twelve years her senior. and it only took for harriet to realize that she might fancy mr. knightly for herself just so emma can realize too that she had always loved mr. knightly after all. wow. who knew that's all it takes? it would have been awesome if we cut out the tons of bullshit parties/get-togethers/whatever where random characters would gossip or charm each other so we could have arrived to this stellar revelation earlier but hey, austen felt like the other stupid parts of this book that i hated were important so--who i am to argue with a classical writer? i just never remember being this annoyed about minutiae descriptions of ordinary events in classical works unlike when i read an austen book. dickens, hugo, dumas, and doyle all have moments where they dwell on piles of descriptive narrative pertaining to scenes that are often not as relevant as others, but at least they kept it down to a minimum and go back to the purpose of their plot in the first place. with austen's emma, it was an indulgent feat that littered a great number of chapters for the second and third volume. by the three hundredth or s...</td>\n",

       "      <td>\\nyou can read this review and more on my blog:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nit took me a couple of weeks to finish this book because honestly, it could be a little dry and frustrating to read at times. considering i am someone who reads a lot of young adult fiction, i am used to fast paced and easy reading, and emma was a lot of things but fast paced and easy are not two words that come to mind when i think about this book.however, some words that do come to mind are: funny, sweet, cute, witty, charming, romantic, and thought-provoking. emma was a new type of character for me. she was a genuinely nice person who wanted to be helpful, but she was also a spoiled snob who thought she knew what was best for everyone. the great thing about this book and the genius of jane austen is that despite her many faults, emma was still likable. but i can't count the number of times i wanted to reach into my kindle, shake some sense into that girl, and tell her to mind her own business. it all starts when emma meets a new friend harriet smith. harriet quickly becomes emma's pet, and emma quickly becomes harriet's heroine. early on in their friendship, harriet receives a proposal from a nice, successful farmer, but because emma is so fond of harriet, she thinks harriet is too good for this farmer and convinces the poor girl to turn him down and set her sights on a richer and more socially acceptable better man.this blunder on emma's part leads to some pretty funny and embarrassing moments for everyone. emma ends up with a completely different mindset about everything by the end of the book, and it was enjoyable reading about her journey and growth. she was never a cruel person and her snobbish behavior came from a good place believe it or not. in truth, harriet was someone way beneath emma's station, but she loved her as a sister almost immediately after meeting her. emma didn't so much need to learn to be a better person as much as she needed to learn to stop picking and choosing what other people needed to do with their lives. she also benefited from learning that she really didn't know half as much about people and life as she thought she did. as a fellow bossy busybody who has learned this particular lesson more times than i can count, it made emma very easy for me to relate to even though i disagreed with nearly every move she made. her heart was in the right place.  it was interesting to see how things came full circle and everyone ended up where they belonged in spite of (or maybe because of) emma's meddling. now i want to discuss emma's romance so look away if you don't want to be spoiled.(view spoiler)[emma falls for mr. knightly!! i wanted them to end up together the first time they interacted, but because of the age difference and their inability to stop fighting long enough to flirt, i wasn't so sure that was going to happen.the romance between emma and mr. knightly didn't seem like a forgone conclusion to me until the moment they danced at the ball, and that didn't happened until the book was more than halfway over. i just about leapt out of my bed and did a little jig when they finally stopped playfully bickering and got down to some real flirting.those two people couldn't have been more perfectly matched and i even got the \"happily ever after\" ending with a wedding that i never expect from older romantic books. *sigh*  (hide spoiler)] despite how long it was, this book was a joy to read from start to finish. i'm glad i took my time instead of rushing right through because i would have missed out on all the feelings i got to experience. i was so proud of the person emma became because i was so frustrated with the person she used to be. i made mention of emma's \"happily ever after\" in my spoiler, but every single character in this book got an \"ever after\" that was just as happy. not one person was left out of the joy.if all of jane austen's books are as romantic and fun as emma and pride and prejudice, i finally get why her works are still beloved and heavily consumed by romantics today. there is a sort of timelessness to her storytelling that transcends the dated but beautiful language. it may have taken her one hundred words to say what authors today convey with ten, but those one hundred words are worth it. i would only recommend emma to those of you who enjoy a nice slow building relationship. the payoff at the end of this book is incredible, but the journey could be a little tiring for some. if you like, classic novels, sweet romance, and interesting character growth, i would add this one to your book bucket list.this book is suitable for all ages, but i would suggest the reading level for ages 12 and up. this review was originally posted on kookie krysp reads</td>\n",

members of the reform club of london, although he seemed to care to do nothing which might attract attention.” opening lines, around the world in 80 days, verne, 1872.this opening paragraph deserves more recognition. with one sentence, verne transports us to time, place and character that are a mix of high english culture, victorian humility and adventurous whimsy. it is interesting that as a frenchman, verne wrote in his language, but it was the english translations that garnered him international recognition. no 1. savile row, burlington gardensirish-born playwright and mp richard brinsley sheridan did live and die on savile row, however at no.14. at the time of publication of around the world in 80 days, no. 1 was newly occupied by the royal geographic society (who resided therein from 1870-1913), from whose rooms victorian era englishmen surveyed her majesty’s empire and planned, funded, and intiated exploration of africa, asia and the south pole. this location was not only signficant in verne’s time, but has since only matured into it’s contemporary grandeur. today, #1 savile row, is known as home to generations of bespoke tailors, discreetly serving english gentlemen and their families, while being recognized as a national heritage list member.“1912 - on 23 december, №1 savile row is purchased from the royal geographical society by hawkes &amp; co. for £38,000,[5] in part because the firm has dressed so many explorers. this was at a time when the international reputation of savile row, the famous street and centre for fine craft tailoring was growing.[11] another £10,000 is spent on converting the premises to suit the business. hawkes &amp; co. is appointed to dress the honourable corps of gentlemen at arms, the british monarch's nearest

explore their building and work via their luxurious website here:http://www.gievesandhawkes.com/about/...to this storied location, verne adds the inscrutable phineas fogg. fogg is described as mathmatical, punctual, wealthy, systematic, an english gentleman who is somewhat of an automon. today, we would say fogg has obsessive complusive disorder (ocd) or perhaps that he has asperger’s syndrome. nonethless, verne uses phineas fogg’s flat affect to create a sense of mystery ala his countryman victor hugo’s the count of monte cristo, while simultaneously brushing phineas fogg with a whimsy that embodies the victorian fantasy of worldwide travel. “phineas fogg was one of those mathematically exact people, who, never hurried and always ready, are economical of their steps and their motions. he never made one stride too many, always going by the shortest route. he did not give an idle look. he did not allow himself a superfluous gesture. he had never been seen to be moved or troubled. he was a man of the least possible haste, but he always arrived in time. however, it will be understood that he lived alone, and, so to speak, outside of every social relation. he knew that in life one must take his share of friction, and as frictions retard, he never rubbed against anyone.” pg 15originally written as contemporary fiction in 1872, today’s reader finds the book loaded with history. mid-way through a century of expansion from roughly 1814 to 1915, the british empire was the hegemonic power of the late nineteenth century. by 1915, it would rule just under 25% of the world’s land mass and population. in 1872, “…there is thus a track of english towns around the world” (pg 112). verne clearly wanted to provide his readers with various snapshots of the globe. for example, we learn that india had 180 million inhabitants (2016 population: 1.325 billion), of which 110 million were governed by the british. of course, travel by ship and train are discussed in reference to fogg and his valet, passepartout’s, discovery of india, but also customs of the land, as seen through european – particularly english – eyes.  “…the entrance into certain hindu pagodas is formally forbidden to christians, and next, that the believers themselves cannot enter there without having left their shoes at the door. it must be remarked here that the british government, for

didn’t. the series is called voyages extraordinaires, and each title was meticulously researched with the intention of creating encyclopedic novels by which readers could learn about various social science (geography, cultures, etc) and scientific ideas (geology, weather cycles, etc). verne was passionate about this endeavor and is quoted as saying, “it is my intention to complete, before my working days are done, a series which shall conclude in story form my whole survey of the world’s surface and the heavens; there are still left corners of the world to which my thoughts have not yet penetrated. as you know, i have dealt with the moon, but a great deal remains to be done, and if health and strength permit me, i hope to finish the task.” two additionally famous titles in verne's series are journey to the center of the earth (1864) and twenty-thousand leagues under the sea. rollicking adventures that were the highest form of media in their day, all three of these publications have been made into feature length films numerous times. while they went about their work differently, two other prolific authors of verne's time were also working on series that ran from the 50s to the 100s of titles. both citizens of the british empire, they were the scotsman r.m ballantyne (1825-1894) and the english war correspondent/ author, g.a. henty (1832-1902). this is a lovely ride, full of colorful experiences, “mild peril,” and mysterious suspense. geography assignments could easily track fogg’s journey via 1872 locations, or by using google to identify historical names, a modern map. one can see why it is considered a classic, and can feel confident recommending it to readers of all ages. the count of monte cristo, hugo,

       "      <td>“in the year 1872, no. 1 savile row, burlington gardens – the house in which sheridan died in 1814 – was inhabited by phileas fogg, esq., one of the most singular and most noticed members of the reform club of london, although he seemed to care to do nothing which might attract attention.” opening lines, around the world in 80 days, verne, 1872.this opening paragraph deserves more recognition. with one sentence, verne transports us to time, place and character that are a mix of high english culture, victorian humility and adventurous whimsy. it is interesting that as a frenchman, verne wrote in his language, but it was the english translations that garnered him international recognition. no 1. savile row, burlington gardensirish-born playwright and mp richard brinsley sheridan did live and die on savile row, however at no.14. at the time of publication of around the world in 80 days, no. 1 was newly occupied by the royal geographic society (who resided therein from 1870-1913), from whose rooms victorian era englishmen surveyed her majesty’s empire and planned, funded, and intiated exploration of africa, asia and the south pole. this location was not only signficant in verne’s time, but has since only matured into it’s contemporary grandeur. today, #1 savile row, is known as home to generations of bespoke tailors, discreetly serving english gentlemen and their families, while being recognized as a national heritage list member.“1912 - on 23 december, №1 savile row is purchased from the royal geographical society by hawkes &amp; co. for £38,000,[5] in part because the firm has dressed so many explorers. this was at a time when the international reputation of savile row, the famous street and centre for fine craft tailoring was growing.[11] another £10,000 is spent on converting the premises to suit the business. hawkes &amp; co. is appointed to dress the honourable corps of gentlemen at arms, the british monarch's nearest bodyguard.”owned by “gieves &amp; hawkes [who] have over 200 years' experience creating the finest bespoke garments. the pre-eminent english tailors internationally renowned for quality.” you can explore their building and work via their luxurious website here:http://www.gievesandhawkes.com/about/...to this storied location, verne adds the inscrutable phineas fogg. fogg is described as mathmatical, punctual, wealthy, systematic, an english gentleman who is somewhat of an automon. today, we would say fogg has obsessive complusive disorder (ocd) or perhaps that he has asperger’s syndrome. nonethless, verne uses phineas fogg’s flat affect to create a sense of mystery ala his countryman victor hugo’s the count of monte cristo, while simultaneously brushing phineas fogg with a whimsy that embodies the victorian fantasy of worldwide travel. “phineas fogg was one of those mathematically exact people, who, never hurried and always ready, are economical of their steps and their motions. he never made one stride too many, always going by the shortest route. he did not give an idle look. he did not allow himself a superfluous gesture. he had never been seen to be moved or troubled. he was a man of the least possible haste, but he always arrived in time. however, it will be understood that he lived alone, and, so to speak, outside of every social relation. he knew that in life one must take his share of friction, and as frictions retard, he never rubbed against anyone.” pg 15originally written as contemporary fiction in 1872, today’s reader finds the book loaded

       "      <td>a blackbird used to sing outside my window. he put a smile on my face when i woke every morning, and he was there when i went to sleep. his song was the first thing i heard when i walked up my path after having been away from home for a while. he would sing all day and even some of the evening and night, proudly chorusing his own short refrains, the songs he had taught himself. he had three songs, all of just five notes each, and one of these was his especial favourite which he would repeat over and over again. not for him were the complicated warbles and song structures of his fellow birds. occasionally he would experiment; a twitter here, a different note there, but then he would confidently return to his favourites, and sing them loudly, his heart fit to burst. he gloried in his song, and i delighted in it. then last week nothing. there is a hole in my life now; something is missing - something of beauty has gone. i feel bereft, as if someone close to me has died. and sometimes, reading this book i would fleetingly experience a similar sense of loss.\"mockingbirds don't do one thing but make music for us to enjoy... sing their hearts out for us. that's why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.\"mockingbirds are a recurring theme in harper lee's only novel. to kill a mockingbird, first published in 1960, is justly a classic. it won the pulitzer prize, and is studied by almost every schoolchild in the usa. in the uk it has been on the national curriculum on and off for a few decades. the first half of the book deals entirely with a small town in the southern united states, a fictitious small town of maycomb, alabama. it describes the events there, during three years of the great depression 1933-35. the events are described as if they are seen by a young girl, six-year-old scout finch. she talks of the special places she loves, the townspeople who live there and their daily lives. for an english reader it is very reminiscent of \"cider with rosie,\" in that it conveys a particular place and time, which has now been lost. also like \"cider with rosie\" the child's point of view evokes feelings of nostalgia, but without sentimentality.scout is caught up in her own world, involving her older brother, jem, and her father, whom she calls by his name of \"atticus\". the children befriend a boy named dill, who stays nearby with his aunt each summer. they invent their own games, and fantasies, one of which involves a neighbour \"boo\" radley, the son of a reclusive family. this is fine fodder for the children, who are in turn terrified of, and fascinated by, boo radley, although few people have ever seen him. the narrator explains the history of the radley family, and what has led to the present situation. the first part of the book thus deals entirely with this childhood, and the reader learns through scout's eyes, the habits and attitudes of the maycomb residents, in preparation for what is to follow. scout is beginning to develop both her attitudes and her moral compass. she has an aversion to all things girlish, and because this is a story reported in flashback, harper lee shows that scout is to become a feminist, for the narrator jean louise (\"scout\") still has an ambivalence about being a southern lady. the child scout also has burgeoning feelings of her sense of fair play, constantly challenging instances in her life, both great and small, which seem wrong to her. one of the most humorous early parts of the novel is the description of the hapless teacher, unused to these maycomb children, trying to instigate her modern city ways and educational methods. the indignation scout feels at being disbelieved when she tells her teacher that she can already read, is very entertaining. scout is told that she must undo the damage atticus has done, and forbid atticus from teaching her further. scout's first day in school is of course a satirical treatment of education; harper lee is mocking it. this part of the novel only refers obliquely to what will be the main theme of the second part.(view spoiler)[ the reader learns that their father has been asked by judge taylor to defend tom robinson, a black man who has been accused of raping a young white woman, mayella ewell. (hide spoiler)] the children become very involved with events, and these teach them about the endemic prejudice in this small town, enabling them to form ideas about those who maintain an unjust system, and those who are fighting against it, in varying degrees. the story is exceptionally moving, involving mob mentality, courage, murder, rape, class and gender issues and conflicts, courage and compassion.harper lee has said that she thinks an author, \"should write about what he knows and write truthfully\". she has denied that this novel is an autobiography, and yet there are many parallels with people and events from her own childhood. for instance, harper lee's father was an attorney, similar to atticus finch,(view spoiler)[ and in 1919, he defended two black men accused of murder. (it was his final criminal case; they were convicted, hanged and reportedly mutilated.) (hide spoiler)] her father was also the editor and publisher of the monroeville newspaper. in to kill a mockingbird scout's mother died when she was a baby, so is absent in the novel. although harper lee was 25 when her mother, (whose maiden name was \"finch\") died, she did have a nervous condition which made her mentally and emotionally absent. the author also had a brother who was four years older than her, just as jem was four years older than scout. and the family had a black housekeeper, who came daily, just as calpurnia does in to kill a mockingbird.harper lee once said, in a 1964 interview, that her aspiration was, \"to be the jane austen of south alabama.\" on a superficial level, anyone less like jane austen would be hard to imagine! yet they both have the same underlying sentiment. they both challenged the social status quo and valued individual worth over social standing. for instance, in one episode calpurnia chastises and punishes scout, because she embarrasses her poorer white classmate, walter cunningham. atticus respects and endorses calpurnia's judgment, even later in the book standing up to his formidable sister, alexandra, when she wants to fire calpurnia. as scout herself grows and develops through the book, she begins to view the women of the town, the \"missionary ladies\" with a satirical eye, thus alienating herself from their influence.the character of tom robinson seems to have been inspired by several events, rather than one actual person.(view spoiler)[ when harper lee was 10 years old, there was a story and local trial covered by her father's newspaper. a white woman near monroeville had accused a black man of raping her. another case at the time was of a black teenager, who was murdered for flirting with a white woman in mississippi in 1955. others have claimed that the book might have been partly inspired by a notorious case in which nine black men were convicted of raping two white women on negligible evidence. (hide spoiler)] however, in 2005, harper lee denied any one influence, although she said that several of them served \"the same purpose\" - that of displaying southern prejudices. it is now thought that this novel, in particular the tom robinson character, acted as a catalyst for the civil rights movement. (view spoiler)[the jury at tom robinson's trial were poor white farmers, who convicted him despite overwhelming evidence of his innocence. in the background many more educated and moderate white townspeople hid behind the law and supported the jury's decision. atticus finch speaks here, as reported by scout,\"\"why reasonable people go stark raving mad when anything involving a negro comes up is something i don't pretend to understand...i just hope that jem and scout come to me for their answers instead of listening to the town\"... i never figured out how atticus knew i was listening, and it was not until many years later that i realized he wanted me to hear every word he said.\" (hide spoiler)]this second part of the novel tells unpalatable truths. it reflects a whole spectrum of views, many nuances of prejudice. but it is very tough to read. harper lee had a piercing eye, and she did not flinch from telling the truth about people, ugly as it is. significant social change was inevitable, but also was the fact that it would be conflict-ridden.the parallels in to kill a mockingbird with harper lee's own life continue. down the street from them lived a family whose house was always boarded up, and when the son got into some trouble the family's father kept him hidden at home for 24 years out of shame. this family seem uncannily like the radleys.but perhaps the most striking resemblance to her life is the character of dill, whom harper lee based on her childhood friend, truman capote. as a child, truman capote lived next door to harper lee, with his aunts, while his mother visited new york city. the author has built capote's imaginative talent for fantasising and story-telling into the character of dill. just as the two children were both boyish (the author was a tomboy) but also loved to read, so were scout and dill. both felt alienated from their peers. because of these strong connections, and the reticence of harper lee to be interviewed about to kill a mockingbird a sort of mythology seems to have grown up around the author. it is claimed that she is reclusive, and there are even rumours that truman capote, with his greater acknowledged body of work, was the true author of this novel too. but in a 2011 interview, harper lee finally said why she never wrote again, \"two reasons; one, i wouldn't go through the pressure and publicity i went through with \"to kill a mockingbird\" for any amount of money. second, i have said what i wanted to say and i will not say it again.\"additionally a letter written by truman capote has been donated to monroeville's museum.

       "      <td>you know it’s a good book when it makes a grown man cry….“people generally see what they look for, and hear what they listen for.”i’ve been putting off reading this book for so long, i have forgotten why… i’m glad that i can finally announce to the world, that i’ve read this all-time classic. it is an immensely well written, morally inspiring and highly enjoyable book. i’m sure this was not the last time that i’ll read “to kill a mockingbird”.i admit, initially i wasn’t going to award this work with 5 stars – the book was not 100% up my alley. not that i thought there was anything wrong with it, but well, i’m just not a big fan of books set in early 20th century america – don’t ask me why, i can’t put a finger on it. so yes, i was immediately put off after the first few pages. however, i soon started to realise why this piece of literature is so famed and critical to read.“sometimes the bible in the hand of one man is worse than a whisky bottle in the hand of (another)... there are just some kind of men who - who're so busy worrying about the next world they've never learned to live in this one, and you can look down the street and see the results.”one of the factors that make this book so special is harper lee’s writing style. though i admit – that one did not hit me straight away. until i started to think about it, i didn’t realise just how amazing it was. the quotes themselves are enough to blow your mind and make you weep, but when you stop and think how tough it must’ve been to write about something so serious and important in a way that this entertaining and inspiring whilst writing from a kid’s perspective. i mean just wow. it amazes me how the author was able to paint such a vivid picture of the courthouse (and pretty much life itself) and still retain that childish innocence and humour in her writing. hats off, no doubt.another thing that one cannot help but notice is the themes and moral lessons within the story. the book touches upon: racial injustice, different classes within a society, gender, courage, compassion and the law itself. and these lessons are powerful if one chooses to listen – no wonder this book is a required reading in many schools. it teaches you how to reach a deeper understanding of yourself as well as how to grow both morally and ethically. this book is one of those you wish you could make everyone in the world read (though i guess unless you choose to do it yourself and really dive into it, it won’t make much difference.) i feel so embarrassed that i had waited until my 20th birthday to read this book, you don’t even know… “we're paying the highest tribute you can pay a man. we trust him to do right. it's that simple.”lastly, i would say that this book has some of the most memorable characters i’d ever come across. i am normally drawn towards very grey-ish characters rather than classical black and white and though this novel certainly has some, one cannot fail to notice that the majority can be categorised into ‘good’ or ‘bad’. this would normally pain me very much however, it somehow seems not to be a problem in this book. the characters are just wonderfully written – atticus, scout, jem; they all come alive in your imagination and somehow seem to stick there long after you’re done reading. i am just in awe. this book is a must-read; it is as simple as that. don’t wait too long to pick it up if you haven’t already - you won’t regret it.</td>\n",

       "      <td>first things first (i'm the realest) this book took me an embarrassingly long time to finish. i really enjoyed the story but found myself in a bit of a reading slump between exams, work and social stuff. the trouble i have with classics, although i really enjoy reading them, is that they require so much more focus for me. i have to sit and really think about what i'm reading and for this reason i struggle to find the time to get through it. i can't read a classic for ten minutes- i either read it for half an hour (or more) or not at all. this is the second jane austen novel i have read and i think it is on par with pride and prejudice. initially i found marianne to be quite frustrating; she is such a hopeless romantic that she forgets common sense. elinor was a little too sensible for my liking... i kind of thought she was boring. honestly though, i was really surprised by how emotionally invested i became in the story and the lives of the dashwood girls. i cried at the end (i cry over a lot of things but whatever). i really loved the characters. they were all so vivid and full of spirit. mrs jennings was an excellent character. i found willoughby and lucy steele to be deplorable- there were other characters i disliked but i thought these two were the worst of them.jane austen is an amazing author and i completely understand why she is the standard to which all authors aspire. i will definitely read more of her work at some stage, but maybe at a time when i have more spare time to dedicate to long reading sessions.</td>\n",

       "      <td>one of my absolute favourite books, which i have read multiple times. a major classic. if at all possible, get an edition with the original illustrations.___________________________________(expanded review based on conversation with jordan)here in switzerland, l'affaire du mot n hasn't quite had the high profile it's received on its home territory. in fact, i'm embarrassed to admit that i hadn't even heard of it until jordan gave me a few pointers earlier today. so, no doubt all this has been said before, but i still can't resist the temptation to add my two centimes worth.in case you're as ignorant as i was about hot topics in the literary world, the furore concerns an edition of huckleberry finn in which the word 'nigger' has been systematically replaced with 'slave'. my initial response was plain surprise. one of the aspects of the book i enjoy most is twain's appallingly exact ear for dialogue. he's reproducing the language actually used in the american south of the 1840s, and this, above all, is what gives the novel its force; so why on earth would anyone want to change it? for example, here's huck's paw in full flow:\"oh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful. why, looky here. there was a free nigger there from ohio -- a mulatter, most as white as a white man. he had the whitest shirt on you ever see, too, and the shiniest hat; and there ain't a man in that town that's got as fine clothes as what he had; and he had a gold watch and chain, and a silver-headed cane -- the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the state. and what do you think? they said he was a p'fessor in a college, and could talk all kinds of languages, and knowed everything. and that ain't the wust. they said he could vote when he was at home. well, that let me out. thinks i, what is the country a-coming to? it was 'lection day, and i was just about to go and vote myself if i warn't too drunk to get there; but when they told me there was a state in this country where they'd let that nigger vote, i drawed out. i says i'll never vote agin. them's the very words i said; they all heard me; and the country may rot for all me -- i'll never vote agin as long as i live. and to see the cool way of that nigger -- why, he wouldn't a give me the road if i hadn't shoved him out o' the way. i says to the people, why ain't this nigger put up at auction and sold? -- that's what i want to know. and what do you reckon they said? why, they said he couldn't be sold till he'd been in the state six months, and he hadn't been there that long yet. there, now -- that's a specimen. they call that a govment that can't sell a free nigger till he's been in the state six months. here's a govment that calls itself a govment, and lets on to be a govment, and thinks it is a govment, and yet's got to set stock-still for six whole months before it can take a hold of a prowling, thieving, infernal, white-shirted free nigger.i'm sorry, but i'm honestly unable to see how anyone could think the above passage was racist or might be improved by substituting 'slave' for 'nigger'. it's incidents like this which create the popular european myth that americans don't understand the concept of irony.if you're curious to know more about the tradition of improving great works of literature by removing dubious words, you might want to take a quick look at the wikipedia article on thomas bowdler which jordan and i were giggling over. bowdler, it turns out, had acted from the best of motives. when he was young, his father had entertained him by reading aloud from shakespeare; butlater, bowdler realised his father had been extemporaneously omitting or altering passages he felt unsuitable for the ears of his wife and children. bowdler felt it would be worthwhile to present an edition which might be used in a family whose father was not a sufficiently \"circumspect and judicious reader\" to accomplish this expurgation himself.he undertook to create a suitably amended version. or, to be exact, he got his sister to do it and then gave out the books under his own name. again, his reasons were unimpeachable: it would have reflected badly on her to admit that she had understood the naughtier passages. i won't criticise dr bowdler or his equally well-meaning modern followers. i just think it's a shame mark twain never had the opportunity to write a story about them.</td>\n",

       "      <td>“the adventures of tom sawyer” is the first mark twain book i’ve read. i was pleasured to realize a large chunk of the book was parodied in a simpsons episode, where bart plays hooky from school, observes, or thinks he observes, a murder of a waiter over chowder, and the entire bit about the trial that goes on, and the man jumping out the window. i haven’t seen that episode in a long while, and much wish to see it again now that i’ve read “tom sawyer”.in terms of readability, i thought, going in, that twain would be very dry, long-winded, old-fashioned, with much abbreviations in dialogue as well as slang. the book was much easier to follow along than i anticipated, however. the slang that is used is reserved to dialogue, and mostly just from huck.i was surprised how much of a role huckleberry finn plays in the book; i expected him only to make a cameo at the end of the story. i had a fanboy moment when he first appeared, even though i haven’t read his own story yet. i really liked his introduction with the dead cat. another thing i was curious about with twain was the frequency with which he used the word ‘nigger’; i know, or thought i knew, he used it a lot in huck finn, like above two hundred times, but i wasn’t sure if this one had it. for the entire story up until huck appeared, blacks were referred to as negroes, i believe, but huck always calls them niggers. i like how twain presented his characters’ attitudes towards blacks though. there’s sort of this distance he treats them with, close to or avowedly looking at them as inferior to whites, but at the same time both tom and huck seem to tolerate them being around, and confess to each other that there’s negroes they actually like, though they don’t want that to get known publicly. in that way, the characters themselves sort of view blacks as equals, but they know society wouldn’t tolerate that, so they’re almost forced to at least publicly look down on them. it’s hard to explain, but i hope you get the gist of what i’m trying to say.one thing that did infuriate me about the writing was twain’s repetition of the word “presently”. it irritated the hell out of me! it becomes such a distraction, every time i see the word, i sigh and shake my head; it’s completely an unnecessary word, the sentences work just fine without it, and it is a very noticeable word. half-way into the book, i was on full-alert for uses of the word. that really sucked a lot of my enjoyment from the book because it became such a distraction. in the latter quarter of the book, twain also became repetitive with the phrase “by and by”, including starting back-to-back paragraphs off with the phrase. altogether, i just think that’s bad writing/editing. in terms of plot, i think the book was okay. some of the adventures the characters undertake reminded me of ones i myself did, and the way they came up with games and adventures brought back memories. the word chapter i think was the one on the master’s gilded dome, where the students seek to embarrass their strict teacher. the writing in this chapter just appeared entirely different than the rest of the story, and it’s the only part of the book i just gave up reading halfway, and moved on to the next chapter. all in all, i think the book is okay. i don’t really see any reason why this book should be a classic; the writing and plot is not great; i’ve read stories by no-name authors i’ve enjoyed more and thought were better written than this. i think the book is more of a classic because for that time, perhaps, stories like this were rare, or because twain was one of the early american writers, perhaps the first great american novelist. but that aside, i don’t think the story or writing was all that great. an okay book, sure, a good book, fair enough, but a masterpiece?i'm torn between two or three stars. rounding up. three stars.</td>\n",

       "      <td>and the only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour, is by going a whaling yourself; but by so doing, you run no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him. wherefore, it seems to me you had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this leviathan.melville employs a fragment of job 1:15 for the epigram of the epilogue: \"...and i only am escaped alone to tell thee.\" in the same way, the reader, after 625 pages of pure sublime masterwork, escapes alone to tell others of the experience. and it is a large, profound experience. as melville says himself, through his surrogate ishmael, \"to produce a mighty book, you must choose a mighty theme\" (497). having found success with his first two novels, \\ntypee: a peep at polynesian life\\n and \\nomoo: a narrative of adventures in the south seas\\n, and then failure with his third, \\nmardi and a voyage thither\\n, a dense philosophical work, melville seems to have found the aristotelian golden mean in the genesis of american literature: the mighty \\nmoby-dick or, the whale\\n.i avoided the book for a long time, daunted as i was by its heft and, well, age and subject matter. yet, as thomas c. foster points out in his book \\nhow to read literature like a professor: a lively and entertaining guide to reading between the lines\\n, it was really my own age that was the impasse: \"...[moby-dick] succeeds by rules of narrative that not many people can grasp (especially at the age of seventeen or twenty, when most of us get fouled in its lines)\" (243). indeed, a book like this makes tall demands of its readership. for example, one should at least be conversational about the \\ntanakh: the holy scriptures\\n, especially in its king james translation; one should have at least a basic familiarity with the great shakespearean tragedies and its chief figures (lear, othello, hamlet, macbeth); and one should have an understanding of the major metaphysical arguments before and of melville's time (hume versus kant; free will versus determinism, etc.). but, really, above all, the \\nking james bible touch\\n is paramount. as the great canadian literary critic northrop frye has it in his book \\nthe great code: the bible and literature\\n, \"...a student of english literature who does not know the bible does not understand a good deal of what is going on in what he reads\" (xii).melville's great book suffers from the same social stigma as so many others, the bible included. along with, say, \\nthe scarlet letter\\n, \\nthe adventures of huckleberry finn\\n, and \\nuncle tom's cabin\\n, people have heard so much about the books, that they feel they have already read them. this sentiment leads to italo calvino's cheeky definition of a classic in his book \\nwhy read the classics?\\n as being a book that one is always \"re-reading,\" never reading for the first time. to be sure, this can also be because one is embarrassed to admit that one has not read some great work or another before. for myself, i didn't read moby-dick until 8 years ago, at age 24, in grad school. and even then, my professor didn't do much to give me a leg up when she said, \"i'm sorry to do this, but, you'll have to do a close-reading of moby-dick; there's no way around it.\" luckily, though i didn't quite take to it on the first reading as i did on this second reading, the experience was peculiar and never left me. when i attempted to negatively criticize it, my arguments were glaringly thin. harold bloom, in \\nthe western canon: the books and school of the ages\\n sums it up best when he says, \"when you read a canonical work for a first time you encounter a stranger, an uncanny startlement rather than a fulfillment of expectations\" (3).most people are familiar with the opening sentence (you've likely just thought it). indeed even people who despise literature and always watched the movie of the books they were to read in school still know the famous line. i thought about this a while and questioned what it is about the line that is so catchy. (and, really, when read with the rest of the paragraph, it is a bit clunky.) then i started thinking through other great literature and riffling through opening sentences for possible iambic pentameters, when i came face to face with none other than \"in the beginning.\" now, i'm sure this has been pointed out before, given the welter of melville scholarship out there, but still it fills one with enthusiasm.in general, it is the opening sentence (featured on a coffee mug of famous opening sentence i bought at the nypl) and the mad ahab out to catch the white whale that people know of the book. scarcely much more, save for maybe the ambiguity of the dynamic between ishmael and queequeg. to know only these two elements of the main plot of the book is to know very little of its bulk, for these takeaways can be gleaned from the first chapter and last three chapters. there are still 131 other chapters! another stigma that has attached itself to the book like a barnacle to a whale is that it is bloated with outdated whaling lore and purports to be an encyclopedia of whaling. like most stigmas, there is truth to this, but allow me to assert my argument for undertaking such a reading project as this without resorting to abridgment.spending, let's say, a month of your life reading moby-dick is not to spend a month reading only one book. it is to spend a month reading through a library: \"there are certain books that, in themselves, are an ideal library. examples: moby-dick....\" (269, \\na reader on reading\\n). again, like the bible (which is also considered a library), this book is not a novel; it is composed of plays, poems, prose poems, narrative, essays, scholarly treatises, philosophy, theology, and more. melville displays his acumen as a sort of polyglot of genres. where cervantes gives us interpolated stories, melville gives us interpolated essays. through ishmael, we get a genius's thoughts on all manner of the popular and the esoteric (melville was considerably well read) synthesized into the metaphor of the human pushing to the brink of madness to capture an elusive whale. the more i think about this major theme of the book, the more i realize how inclusive, how universal it is. yet, it is distinctly american. whereas faust sold his soul to mephistopheles, ahab looks to himself to obtain his goal.approaching the book in thirds is a good way to plan your reading project. the first third introduces the principal characters and sets us off on the pequod on christmas day (i.e. christ's traditional birth date). the second third gives us the weight of scholarly discourse on whaling, but melville rewards the alert reader with constant dips into the poetic and philosophical modes. finally, the last third, the extended climax of the book, pays off with dividends for the efforts of the reader. this is a book best read at a slow pace. i recommend no more than 20 pages a day, in order to properly ingest and absorb the glut of its offerings.the undeniable standout character is, of course, that black hole ahab, into which everything on its event horizon is pulled and out of which nothing escapes. melville transcends himself with ahab. the shakespearean soliloquies (for even when he speaks to others, he is really just speaking to himself) take up the torch passed from shakespeare to milton and now to melville. ahab captures the viscera of the american spirit in a way that ishmael just cannot, clinging to reason above all. where ishmael says \"give me the privilege of making my own summer with my own coals,\" ahab, in the face of death, proclaims, \"to the last i grapple with thee; from hell's heart i stab at thee; for hate's sake i spit my last breath at thee\" (12, 623).i glance through all of my marginalia, post-it notes, highlighting, etc., and i am overwhelmed with all there is to say of this great book. perhaps one day i will set to the task of distilling all of these notes and thoughts into a long essay (really, only another book will come closer to doing it justice), but--alas--i must bring this \"review\" to a close. suffice it to say this: in job 41:1, god says to job, \"canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook?\" melville's ahab answers with a mad, \"yes, i can.\" who would not want to read a book written about the man who, unlike job, set out to defy god's limitation on mankind? a mighty theme indeed.</td>\n",

(as a noob writer, i struggle when it comes to describing a scene and this book is more than a revelation to me).but somewhere in between, you look up mid reading and remember that lo is just 12 and you can't help but internally debate whether you should continue or not. after all, well, i guess everyone has heard of lolita at one point in their life. the reaction can be any, embarrassed, disgusted, revolted, shiver of terror. be as it may, when you sit down and read the novel, you are reminded of how beautiful a book can be, in spite of its scandalous theme. and let me tell you, the book is more than what people perceive it as. and that is what i believe makes it a classic. the writing claws its way into the reader and forces them into a submissive state, letting them go only when the book is finished. but if you think it's over when you turn the last page over, oh my dear, you are so wrong. a truly great book will find a place in your deep consciousness, staying there till the end. at least that's what i feel.irrelevant verdict: yes. obviously, it is a must-read.</td>\n",

       "      <td>ok, deep breath here...i haven't read, or better to say understood, homer as much as i ought to. i've picked up and put down the odyssey a few times and i just hate to admit that it's not clicking for my modern mind as much as it ought to. it's not the deep brow'd blind sage, it's me. did not read it in high school, was unfortunately lacking in my ancient greek history and mythos (getting better, hopefully) and therefore the gods, and gods upon gods, and the drama between them all plays out so intricately that my eyes start to wobble and my head it spins. man, do i hate admitting it, and in the sparkling company of goodreads at that, but it's just the damn truth. i like to quietly judge people who don't dig the classics because their \"boring\" or \"weird\" or \"long-winded\" or \"old fashioned\" as much as anybody, but in this case i have met the enemy and he is me.homer's one of those writers who hover over...well...everything, of course. my beloved joyce puts him to some obvious use in the obvious place. philosophy professors are always referencing it, nietzsche and bernard williams like to use him, keats, pound, milton, etc etc...it's the kind of thing that a voracious reader will sort of get an inkling of even if they've never actually cracked the pages themselves. isn't it strange how that happens?so i am now no longer burdened by master's thesis woes (passed! on my birthday, no less! whut whut!) and thus am free to tackle a big dog guilt-free. i just cannot call myself an educated reader without having the homer in my brain-shelf, i just can't. it really is a kind of shame that it's not as central a part of the curriculum as it used to be...i'm embarrassed by how little i really know about these characters, or rather how much i thought i knew and really hadn't retained.so i'm going straight to the source- the battle of troy, 2700 years of accumulated rage and blood and wisdom...and luckily i found the translator who can make it happen (for me, at least). fagles. fagles! his \"orestia\" rocked my world and now he's the go-to guy for all things classical. i wish i were smart and worldly enough to get a comparison of translations under way but i'm doing all i can to take on the challenge the iliad is throwing down.glad to say that at around book 5 the confusion is a presence, but not a hinderance. it's fucking death metal. compulsively readable, incredibly gutsy and frank and vivid. there's a humanity here which really does shine through all the blood grudges and slaughter and dick-waving and general bellicosity, as a lot of other reviewers have pointed out. people start fights, rend flesh, and either cry to their mamas materializing out of the sea (!?) or are whisked away in the nick of time by generous goddesses. men die for their comerades, beg favor from the gods who are in the midst of a honeymooners row the likes of which are no man's buisness. the gods feel pain, but they do not die...***finished! stayed up (almost) all night to cap it off at last! no sense in trying to communicate the breadth and density and power of the text, so i'll just post some of my favorite quotes in due time (i.e. when and if i get around to it).</td>\n",

       "      <td>yt video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvv2w1...this is my third pass at the beginning text of western literature. from fitzgerald to fagles, and now to lattimore, aided with the greek text from loeb library, i've both savored the richness of the homeric greek and recoiled at the graphic, violent intensity of its content. in one sense, this is the blueprint for all country music: a man loses his girlfriend, stops working, sulks, and then his best friend dies. in another sense it is a narrative onslaught that foregrounds a panorama of mythological history (for the genesis of which we must turn to hesiod).it must be noted that the work represents a much greater complexity than mainstream academia would have us believe. it is not simply what its opening lines tell us; it isn't merely the muses' account, via homer, of achilles' wrath (μῆνῐς) and its destruction. in fact there is very much within the novel that supersedes the wrath, which counterbalances the power of his wrath to transcend even destinies decreed by the immortals (an interesting suspension of the determinism that underpins the whole framework). like the torah (or even milton's retelling of the pentateuch), it is too simplifying to say that it is a \"song\" of man's disobedience. after all, there was a great deal of destruction already inherent in the fruit.homer has (anachronistically) confirmed hippocrates's aphorism that life is short but art is long. over two millennia later, the great lover of books and wine, clifton fadiman, placed the iliad at the start of his \\nthe new lifetime reading plan: the classic guide to world literature, revised and expanded\\n. of it and the odyssey, he says, \"they are the first as well as the greatest epics of our civilization\"; \"achilles is the first hero in western literature; and ever since, when we talk of heroic qualities, achilles is somewhere in the back of our minds...\"; \"the essential quality of the iliad is nobility\"; and, finally, \"all imaginative artists, but only if they are great enough, seem contemporaries [of homer].\" others have noted some points of intrigue: richard jenkyn's, in \\nclassical literature\\n, states, \"the iliad is a story without villains...\" and \"homer...has shaped a distinctive picture of the divine.\" robert b. downs, in \\nbooks that changed the world\\n, declared, \"...homer's epic creations...established for all time the greatness of greek literature.\" harold bloom affirms the greatness in his introduction to his eponymous compendium of critical essays: \"the iliad, except for the yahwist, dante, and shakespeare, is the most extraordinary writing yet to come out of the west....\" simone weil, a lover of the iliad, declares force as the true center of the epic, in her monumental essay \"the iliad, or the poem of force.\" and finally: the renowned scholar alberto manguel, in his \"biography\" of homer's epics, quotes raymond queneau: \"every great work of literature is either the iliad or the odyssey.\"in his remarkable \"visual essay,\" \\nthe infinity of lists\\n, the late umberto eco uses the shield of achilles (from book xviii) to describe a closed form. this is because homer is fully engaged in the whole of his cultural milieu: its social norms and mores, its philosophy, its history (myth), its values. he effortlessly spins his yarn with a nearly complete catalogue of characters both mortal and immortal (and, in achilles's case, in between). in the event that he needs a little help, the muses are his google (but not really, as we know). homer is in touch with every emotion and in every context, as if he himself has been a warrior, a lover, a peasant, a king, even an enslaved woman toiling at the distaff. the encyclopedic sweep of his efforts died out in the form of epic poetry (milton is perhaps the swan song of the form, and poe drove in the nail in his essay \"the poetic principle\"), but it has resurfaced in the last half century or so with books like pynchon's \\ngravity's rainbow\\n and david foster wallace's \\ninfinite jest\\n. the impulse to distill the whole of life, to trap within amber the collective consciousness of an era, has had conflagrations in europe and the americas (bolaño roberto being a chief example from south america), as expertly traced out in \\nthe maximalist novel: from thomas pynchon's gravity's rainbow to roberto bolano's 2666\\n. in a real sense, homer's epics, supplemented with hesiod on one side of history and the greek tragedians on the other, was the bible (biblion) for the greek peoples. so much so, that, even in the days of the early christian church, we see the people reacting to paul and barnabas like characters out of homer:and when the crowds saw what paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in lycaonian, “the gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!” barnabas they called zeus, and paul, hermes, because he was the chief speaker. and the priest of zeus, whose temple was at the entrance to the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates and wanted to offer sacrifice with the crowds. (acts 14:11-13, esv)one of the major focuses of the text is that of honor and nobility, what makes a man's life glorious. in the iliad the answer appears to be found through the fire of warfare. in other words, the greatest warrior is the most noble person. achilles on the achaian side and hektor on the torjan side represent the ideals of ancient greek eugenics. they are great and respected because they are powerful in battle. the intellect is represented in odysseus and nestor, but, in the heat of a skirmish, intellect is suspended in favor of blood lust. it is ironic, then, that helen should be the epicenter of the ten-year ware. like achilles, her stage time is minimal. homer does not litter the narratives of the battles with reminders of helen as the object of the opposition. though this started the war, it recedes to the background and the two-layer chess match--a dramatic, soap opera-like interweaving of mortals and immortals and their respective power politics--takes precedence.a feminist reading must be mentioned. yes, to a large degree, homer's epics cast women in a light that is far less than savory. brisies, for example, and helen herself, can definitely be chalked up to nothing more than war booty (forgive the pun). yet, we also cannot bury our heads in the sand and deny (or rewrite) history. to take weil's perspective, this is a culture of force: force, aggression, violence wins. unfortunately for women of the time, this is apparently the recipe for happiness in a greek man: \"when a man has been well filled with wine and with eating / and then does battle all day long against the enemy, / why, then the heart inside him is full of cheer....\" no mention of sex! notice, too, how aphrodite acts to bring helen and paris to bed together in book iii; and how hera colludes with aphrodite (among others) to bed/distract zeus in book xiv (i also cannot help but note here how zeus prefaces their intimate encounter with a list of all his philandering--how foreign to our sentiments!). i'm afraid that the sexual politics here, and especially in terms of gender, are a bit more complex than an immature reading of the narrative yields. i will avoid the concept of willingness, because i don't think we can debate that with the mindset of a homer or contemporary; we can only approach this with damaging revisionist presentism. i will, instead, end this shaky discussion of gender with a thought i had: with such vivid, visceral details of violence, why is there such reticence when it comes to sex? when it comes to warfare, we get this level of detail:this man peneleos caught underneath the brow, at the basesof the eye, and pushed the eyeball out, and the spear went clean throughthe eye-socket and tendon of the neck, so that he went downbackward, reaching out both hands, but peneleos drawinghis sharp sword hewed at the neck in the middle, and so dashed downwardthe head, with helm upon it, while still on the point of the big spearthe eyeball stuck.(book xiv, 493-499)oh, my zeus! but when it comes to sex, the most detail we get is they \"lay in love\" or paris's invitation to helen to \"go to bed and turn to lovemaking.\" one is tempted to reason that, given a culture devoid of judeo-christian morals, for example, such blatant omission of sexual conquest seems unexpected. when we think of ancient greek and trojan warriors, we think of primitive brutes plundering cities and ravaging women. yet we only see one side of this in the authoritative reporter of the culture. in an aesthetic sense, it is historically very difficult to describe sex in writing without the narrative collapsing (not everyone is an ovid). this has led to such treasures as literary review's annual bad sex in fiction award. but i hesitate to think that homer had this in mind. i am left to take a clue from helen's expression of embarrassment when zeus wants to have sex with her on high where all the others can see (to be sure, he doesn't choose this deliberately; he is just urgent under her spell), and zeus's acquiescence and gesture to wrap them in a golden cloud. like most preconceptions we have of homer, i think a closer reading will lead to a deeper view of what is really being said (or not said). this is not to excuse waspy values; only to rescue a great work from sophomoric thin-slicing.in the end, i am more of a longinian reader. that is, i hunt for the sublime in literature above the fracturing avenues of literary theory (o, how i wish i could pursue my master's degree over again!). for me, the most sublime moment comes in book ix. this book is a close formal relative of the \\nthe book of job\\n, in that three friends of achilles take turns trying to counsel and sway him in the midst of his lowest season in life (though job's is admittedly worse). in this midst of these speeches and achilles's rejoinders, we get this:i carry two sorts of destiny toward the day of my death. eitherif i stay here and fight b...</td>\n",

(uncle phil collins, however, had my 30th birthday marked off on his calendar.) this toothless old guy makes the boys (and bitches. this isn't a gay version) steal for him. there was nothing homoerotic or sinister about any of it. what the hell? not even when oliver steals sausages.right...[i read all of the classics 'cause they were cheap in paperback. pretty much no other reason than that. at least no other reason why classics over any other type of book.]i also gave up on david copperfield. it's not a coincidence that my fickleness kicked in right around the time his titular (testicular) leads dropped their testes (told ya). i couldn't take the wide-eyed shit. the books were too long. i hated the pedestal women in their lives. yeah, there is good stuff inside. but dickens can be such a dick! 'a christmas story' had freaking cool ideas (the ghosts of the past, present and future). great expectations was haunting. trapping yourself in your own twist desires, becoming a ghost before your time. he suffered from having to stretch out his works over time for money. much like tv shows that jump the shark these days, probably. but why did he have to tack on the sop? i know there was a darker eye in there, somewhere. one little orphan didn't change anybody. people are not waiting to be picked up and set on pedestals to redeem all. that especially bugged me about the women when i was young. you'd think a man who was born in a prison would know that about different sides. didn't he meet all types of women in the different circles he moved in?you pick yourself up out of the dirt, if you can, and try and forget the taste of it in your mouth. mother/whore complexes? shit. i liked all of the stuff about wolves in sheeps clothing in wolves clothing in sheeps clothing. that was the best part of the part of oliver twist that i read.okay, what really happened is that i threw the book down and cried out something like: \"is this never gonna end? i didn't get my panties in a twist over charles dickens' pity party that was oliver! twist! the party part was missing. jesus should show up to be savior and turn all the water into wine. or the inmates could make some hooch. just saying...yeah, the sob story part annoyed me too. i wasn't lying about all that. i'm just trying to sound smarter over the being bored stuff. (maybe i should play up on the whole \"fourteen\" part of the story.)i was all set to post a photo of the chef boyardee oliver twist advertisement, but i couldn't find it! not fair!here's a photo from the david lean adaptation. i love david lean.when my mama made me be her slave (think shirley jackson. the film version starring vincent price), i'd make her do the oliver! \"please sir, may i have some more?\" before i'd go cook her dinner. it was always \"whatever you wanna fix\" for us. child abuse stinks. dickens knew it. i knew it.we was beat before we was born!i did love bleak house and our mutual friend. it's not all dickens, just little orphan chuckie.p.s. on lost, the annoying english guy carries around an unread copy of our mutual friend. he's read them all in order and is saving the last one for before he dies (hope he never got to read it. i gave up on lost). i know that this was done somewhere else, i just can't remember where it was from. the same exact thing about carrying around our mutual friend. anyone got a better memory than me? (hope it's not from something totally embarrassing. i'll scratch my head over who an actor is. after consulting the imdb, i'll turn red because they were from a canadian teen show. \"i was uh... wrong...i've never seen that boy before in my life!\")p.s.s. in no way is david simon like charles dickens. the wire, like dickens, was interested in how institutions fuck with people. okay, that one way. but still! david simon never resorted to sop. the good things that happened happened along with the bad, not changing everything. the way that the bad shit is like a ghost coming back to haunt you as it will, or living behind a wall of sick feeling of memories. the good is the fresh air you sometimes get to breathe before it starts to stink again. memories suck. no wonder dickens wrote so many autobiographical ones to pretend there was ever gonna be any fresher air.</td>\n",

       "      <td>some of you may ask \"what were you thinking, mizuki? why did you give the bell jar only two stars? isn't this book like, a classic?\"i am aware of the fact that sylvia plath is a famous poet and the bell jar is considered a classic, and i do agree that the writing is poetic and beautiful, the story is also very honest and realistic as well. in fact, plath's writing and the first half of the book deserve four full stars; but sadly...everything took a nosedive when the heroine suffers a mental breakdown with depression.here're a few things i'd like to clarify:(1) i understand how sucky and painful it is for a person to suffer depression and become mentally ill. (2) i understand how depressing it is to lose the scholarship you had dreamed of for the longest of time and realize that you are in fact not as special and extraordinary as you had always believed yourself to be.(3) i understand how depressing and suppressing it is for young women of the 1950s to have no way out aside from getting married, having kids and being housewives.(4) i do feel sorry that the main character embarrassed herself in new york when she was surrounded by people from the ny fashion scene and she didn't have a clue about how she was supposed to behave around people from the well respected circles. no one should be humiliated like this.(5) i do feel bad that the mc was later assaulted and beat by a guy, it's a horrible experience. but strangely enough, the mc seemed to burst this experience aside without further mention, whilst she kept moaning and whining about minor things.still all the great writing and my understanding cannot cover for the insufferable main character, her constant whining and moaning, her complaining about everything and everyone around her.if the bell jar is a young adult novel, i would have long called the mc out on being such an ungrateful spoiled brat. my stomach was turning over and over with distaste when i read that the mc's mother single-handedly raised her daughter after her husband passing away, still the mc hated her mother. nothing the mother did and said could please her, nothing.let's give you one more example:the mc's mother went to the asylum to visit her daughter, she brought her roses because it was her birthday; the mother kept begging her daughter to tell her what she had done so wrong in her childhood which caused her to end up in an asylum. the mc's reaction to this is: \"i hate her.\"bitch, please.i'm not saying the mc's mother is the perfect mom, she had her own shortcoming and she doesn't seem to understand what's going on in her daughter's mind. but hey, if you had to insist on hating your mother so much, at least give me some reasons, some explanation, some examples to see why your hatred is justified. damn it!not to mention said mc also thought poorly of her female companies/friends and her suitor. in her eyes, those who were in the same age group with her were all boring, shallow, stupid and inferior than her, and god forbid that those girls she met in new york be richer and more worldly than her! it's just unacceptable! don't get me wrong, many of these girls are in fact vain and unlikable, but it doesn't look like they are all out to get the mc's blood. for god's sake!the great writing also cannot cover for the author's fault in engaging her main character with the readers. as beautiful the writing is and as realistic, vividly written and interesting the story (especially the mc's job in new york and the vanity of the ny fashion scene) is, i still cannot overlook the lack of feeling in the writing and the lack of reasons and explanation beyond characters' personalities and actions. for example, can we manage to see the reason why the mc hated her mother so very much? nap.i do think it's a painfully honest and realistically, poetically written book, the feeling of pain, emptiness and alienation is beautifully expressed through the writing; and i suspect something has been lost in translation (i read the chinese version of the book), but in the end i'm still disappointed, i especially don't enjoy how the story goes once the mc got a mental breakdown, after the breakdown, the bell jar loses much of its charm in my eyes and things get very, very sandy and boring. what a pity.plus i honestly don't feel very sympathetic after finished reading the mc's story. her story to me is more like a story about a girl who thinks she's so special because she's such a straight-a ideal student and she's so much smarter and better than anyone her age; but then she goes to new york and realizes she isn't so very special because there are larger fishes in the sea and she meets a bunch of girls who are all from much richer families than hers. her self-confidence goes to the toilet and eventually she gets a mental breakdown because she's so unhappy with her life. full stop.it's not a ya, but sadly the story and its mc made me feel like i'm reading one.</td>\n",

but in my opinion, it is not deserving of that title. my experience of reading it lead me to conclude that it lacks depth. that might not be your experience but in my view, this chaotical and illogical narrative featuring a protagonist that isn’t exactly sympathetic, doesn’t have much going for it. moreover, i think sylvia must have been at least slightly embarrassed of it herself, that is why she allegedly published it under a pseudonym. plath wanted it to be distinct from her other more serious (and in my view, much better) writing and she reportedly referred to this novel as a potboiler- something that addressed the popular tastes of the day. she wanted to create something that would sell. in her journal, she wrote how there is a real market for literature focusing on hospital and mental illnesses and that she was a fool if she didn't take advantage of it (i.e. use her own personal experiences to write the novel). this lead to her writing this semi-autobiographical novel, which she according to her husband, wrote fairly quickly. she found a british published sooner than an american one. one editor wrote to her: “we didn’t feel that you had managed to use your materials successfully in a novelistic way.” that’s exactly my opinion as well. on the other hand, in one letter to her mother, plath wrote that she needed to write this novel to get over her past experiences. that might be additional motivation, but if it was therapeutic for plath (which i doubt because she killed herself shortly after), it doesn't mean it will be therapeutical for the reader.the bell jar doesn’t feel like a novel. i had to do a lot of research to make myself believe that it was actually published prior to her death. i was so sure that it was an unfinished novel, that it was published by mistake- even after reading otherwise. but no, sylvia did see this novel published in uk, she just didn’t deem it worthy of her name. rightly so, i might add, for she was so much better than this novel, capable of writing much better. my initial thoughts were that the only reason why she has written a novel of such a poor quality was that she was mentally ill when she was writing it. then i remembered that she wrote most of her poetry while she was depressed but her poetry is exceptional nevertheless. she was obviously capable of writing well even while she was depressed. now, that i know that she probably wrote it for financial reasons, i understand some things better. i still think we shouldn’t appreciate her poetry less on account of this poorly written novel. whatever were her reasons for writing it, i will continue to see this novel separately from her powerful poems and will never think less of them.the autobiographical aspect of the bell jarthere are many autobiographical elements in the bell jar (plath even included entire episodes from her own life- google it if you want to know exactly how and where) but somehow they don’t make the novel seem more real. the narrative is told from a point of view of esther, a young (supposedly brilliant- though this is not exactly manifested in the novel) woman. the novel opens with esther’s trip to new york and is based on plath’s personal experience as a guest editor of mademoiselle. anyhow, the character of esther goodwood find herself somewhat at crossroads. she is not sure what she will do with herself. being an accomplished student, miss greenwood always imagined an amazing future for herself but now she is not so sure. i do think that first part of the novel had potential and it is something that many people can relate to- that feeling when you’re leaving university and you have no idea what life installs for you. what was odd, however, was the way that esther seems to observe other young ladies who try to befriend her (for example doreen) from some distance. i found it very hard to relate to esther on account of this. for example, her friend doreen appears at esther’s door but esther closes down the door on her, leaving her to vomit on the hallway and is glad when she is gone by the morning. shortly after, doreen experienced food poisoning and enjoy is because she likes other people (doreen included) to fuss over her and take care of her. perhaps because this esther’s the best chance at intimacy and the only time when esther is not able to puss other away. the second part of the novel, one that describes her breakdown and treatment is also founded on plath’s personal experiences. somewhere along the way, her psychiatric treatment begins. this novel is considered a critique of a patriarchal society and also a warning against bad treatment of women in psychiatric institutions. why i can see certainly see why these themes are important, i can't say that the novel addressed them in the right way. i will explain what my problem with this novel is as soon as i include this spoiler alert. spoiler alertthis part of review is infested with spoilers, so do skip it if you didn’t read this one. i don’t go into details about the plot (not that there is much of a plot anyway) but i shall reference events that have occurred in different stages of the novel, so if you want to dive in not knowing anything- skip this part!my problem with the bell jar here is my problem with the bell jar. we have a protagonist who is completely self- obsessed to the point it is sickening and frankly it seems to border with sociopath behaviour. esther moans and moans about everything. her narrative is a succession of never ending complaints. she hates everyone and everything. apparently, nobody is good enough for her. oddly enough, that’s not even the worst part of the novel. as irritating as that might have been, it could have been overlooked if there wasn’t for something else, something much more sinister.do you know what scares me the most? esther’s attitude towards other women. no, it is not her shyness that is keeping her away from establishing something that would even remotely resemble a friendly relationship with other women. it is her negative view of women. i didn’t notice that esther had some speech defect or social anxiety that would prevent from communicating with her own gender, she is, for example, very eloquent when it comes to deceiving her professors so that she wouldn’t have to study for a class she hates. when it benefits her, she can be eloquent, so i don’t think that she can get away with an excuse of being an introvert/shy. if there is a woman esther likes, she must be some poetess dead for centuries, at any rate no women living in her present time is worthy of her attention or god forbid friendship. god forbit that esther feels any sympathy for any other women or even considers her worthy of a thought. patriarchal society is the devil. women? they’re a step lower than that, something so lowly that it doesn’t even deserve a name. with the exception of esther, she is the best thing that has ever happened to this world, but we faulty humans, fail to grasp her greatness. how will she ever punish us? why, by taking herself away from us. goodbye, cruel world, i was always too grand for you.let’s look at esther’s life for a second. she was raised by a single mother who in the course of this novel acts very lovingly towards her. yes, she tries to make her think about practical things- but what women doesn’t do that? ester hates her mother and enjoys making her life’s miserable. why? ok, let’s that one slip. is there a single female character in this whole novel that esther cares about? forget that. is there any character of any gender that she cares about (expect herself)? does she ever stop to wonder how someone else might feel? does she care about others? is she ever emphatic? this book makes me sad but it was not esther i felt for, but those around her. i only felt sad in a general way, because the bad treatment of mental patients would make everyone feel down. mostly, i felt sad because i know that there are women like esther. women making things hard for other women. women making other women feel bad about the fact they are- women. women criticizing other women nonstop. women who deep inside hate themselves because they are- women. i’ve felt this attitude many times, usually i just ignore such women and focus my attention on all those smart, intelligent and amazing women in this world- and there are plenty of those. don’t let anyone try to convince otherwise. i don’t think it is normal to be an adult woman and dislike every single person of your own gender that you come across with. it is not like she came across any really bad women. some weren’t the brightest, and esther much enjoyed making fun of those, but did any actually tried to harm her? somebody expected her to make a summer job because she was a student? how dare they! basters?! esther is all that, she is incredibly intelligent and she can’t possibly degrade herself with a summer job, better to refuse to wash her hair – that will teach a patriarchal society a lesson. was there a single woman in this novel that tried to do her serious harm? weren’t many of them in fact friendly? it is not really fair to see them as lower beings just because they are not (or so we're made to think) as smart as esther.esther vs. everyone as for esther’s finance buddy, i’m sorry but didn’t she chose him herself? didn’t she feel smug about it? didn’t she feel that she finally belongs to society now, didn’t she felt more accept among other students because she had a serious boyfriend? just like the protagonist of the catcher in the rye esther desperately wants to belong to the society but at the same time she detests it. she wants to be able to look everyone from above, but she also wants to feel loved and accepted. she is like those poor people who talk endlessly about the corruption of the wealt...</td>\n",

       "      <td>it's the easiest thing to describe war and peace with a lot of grandiose nothing statements. like this one they got on the back, \"if life could write, it would write like tolstoy.\" and when you're reading it it really tends to feel like these abstract notions. i found myself thinking that instead of connecting to it on a personal level the way novels tend to be a one on one interaction between another mind and yours, this felt like collectively participating in or witnessing something that's both old and continuous, like seeing the pyramids in person. these ideas that end up seeming silly and overly reverent in retrospect just spill out on their own. it could be cultural, the fact that you don't need to have read it or even read in general to still recognize it as one of the great works of literature. so it could be hype, which again is silly and arbitrary. on the other hand the actual work, the words on the page, is so original it seems like billing it as a \"classic\" distracts from how experimental a work it truly is. you can take tolstoy's word for it that it's not a novel, it doesn't have the kind of structure of something like anna karenina. the parts that make it up, the romance, the class commentary, the family drama, the war narrative, the historical documentation, the philosophical commentary, all these pieces succeed well enough on their own that some individual chapters could work as short stories, and yet they all work fantastic in concert with one another. and that's part of tolstoy's grand project with this thing, to critique our basic views of history and life by offering up patterns and connections between these seemingly unconnected aspects. tolstoy's is set apart from others who do similar ideas by tying this in to his religious viewpoints and his humanistic ideas.so as tempted as you may be to say, \"a man didn't write this; life wrote this,\" it's still deeply entrenched in tolstoy's very individual ideas, and in fact that's the reason it exists as the original work it is. tolstoy's literary genius is his ability to do full justice to the thoughts, feelings, and words of people who are not him. tolstoy's not quite a nationalist, but there are so many characters that are and get glittery eyes when senpai emperor notices them, that someone who's not paying attention could call the novel nationalistic. and though napoleon is a mustache twirling villain in this thing, he gets treated with far more examination than, say, the embarrassing strawman portrayal of joan of arc in henry vi, part 1. tolstoy definitely puts him through the grinder and berates the historians for ever venerating him, but it's done with thoughtful nuance.ultimately, the things that hooked me while reading (which run contrary to how i tend to approach novels) are the basic narrative and character stuff. tolstoy's the farthest thing from subtle (window open to the west, napoleon's coming from the west, wow bravo leo) but he doesn't need to be that subtle because he puts everything out there and still makes it work. it's incredibly accessible, just intimidating cause of the physical heft of it. you could not give a damn about history or the problem of induction and still get carried by everyone's troubles and triumphs and their intersecting arcs. i didn't even know that much about the time period and napoleon's wars and i kept up just fine, picking up some knowledge along the way. the book is enjoyable and impressive, and you should read it not to have read it and mark it off a list, but because you're bound to be taken by something in it. strong recommendation.</td>\n",

       "      <td>http://notesfromzembla.wordpress.com/...adame bovary was one described by vladimir nabokov’s father as “the unsurpassed pearl of french literature”; nabokov felt the judgement still stood when he was writing his memoir ‘speak, memory’ and indeed the judgement still stands today. madame bovary remains the most modern of all classic novels, it’s themes of adultery, sexual freedom and consumerism resonate more deeply today when it was written, its story would not look out of place in a modern day soap opera or romance novel, in many ways madame bovary was the first romance novel, yet flaubert was able to elevate madame bovary beyond the copulation of cliché’s typical of most romance novels, as it rises as beautiful and translucent as the skin of its heroine against the red sheets where her lover, leon gazes at her admiringly, to become one of the greatest works of art and literature of all time.the novel begins with the introduction of charles bovary and his grotesque and bizarre hat, as he makes a rather bad impression on his new class mates on his first day at school; “it was one of those composite hats, where you find traces of the bearskin, shako, derby, sealskin cap, and cotton nightcap; in short, one of those wretched things whose dumb ugliness has depths of expression like an imbecile’s face. oval, stiffened with whalebone, it began with three round lumps; then alternating lozenge-shaped patches of velvet and rabbit skin separated by a red band; after that came a sort of bag that ended in a cardboard polygon covered with complicated braiding, from which hung, at the end of a long thin cord, small twisted gold threads in the form of a tassel. the cap was new; its peak shone” in this novel we soon become accustomed to the fact that objects are almost secondary characters in and of themselves, they function as extensions of the character associated with them. thus charles’s hat creates an image of him in our minds of incompetence, awkwardness even ugliness, a grotesque and pathetic figure, a wretched person whose imbecility is perfectly matched in his headgear.the unnamed narrator then further expands on charles’s life and character. he is the product of an unhappy marriage, his father is nothing more than a rake and a boor, his mother is emotionally neurotic, a dreamy woman who pins all her hopes and dreams from a failed marriage and unhappy life on her son, charles. charles indeed seems to meander through life, after beginning his medical studies his mother sees him becoming a great and famous doctor: he fails his first medical exam, his mother blames the examiners, he passes second time and becomes and sets up a small practice in a small town named tostes, where his mother had been awaiting the death of an old doctor and had contrived via machiavellian means to marry him off to an ugly, old spinster who possesses a considerable fortune.thus we meet madame bovary the second, who acts as a kind of extension of madame bovary the first. “but his wife was master, she watched over his comings and goings…she had to have her cup of chocolate every morning. she complained incessantly of her nerves, of nerves, of depression and faintness. when people left her she couldn’t bear her loneliness…” charles has swapped one neurotic for another, the thought of visiting her cold bed at night, of being held in her bony arms fills him with disgust, his life again meanders mediocrely along until the arrival of a letter in the middle of night sealed with blue wax. (remember the colour, it will prove to be important.) it is a letter from a farmer named pierre rouault, who has broken his leg and requires urgent attention. image on his night-time journey to the farmer there is a beautiful description of the scenery, “the flat landscape stretched out as far as they eye could see, and the clumps of trees around the farmhouses showed up, at wide intervals, as patches of deep violet on that vast grey surface, which blurred at the horizon into the dullness of the sky” note the dull, yet serene atmosphere of the scene, as charles’s horse ambles towards his destination, the dullness is however punctuated by the deep violet of the farmhouses, notice also how charles is asleep on his horse but is constantly jolted awake by her and how charles’s mare takes fright as they enter the farm; plainly something momentous is about to take place in the slumbering life of charles. charles is greeted by the farmer’s daughter, emma, who is wearing a blue merino dress; noticeably a fire is blazing within the kitchen. whilst making pads for the bandages for pierre rouault’s leg, emma keeps on pricking her fingers, and somewhat suggestively, puts them to her full lips to suck them. charles’s gaze rests on her hands; “charles was surprised by the whiteness of her nails. they were lustrous, tapering, more highly polished than dieppe ivories and cut into almond shape. yet he hands were not beautiful, not white enough perhaps, and rather bony at the knuckles; they were also too long, with no softening curves.” if charles can be symbolised by his hat, then what do emma’s hands, hitherto the longest physical description in the book, say about her? superficially attractive perhaps, on first glance the lustre of her pale nails disguise the ugliness of her hands, which in comparison to the nails are dark and bony. charles’s gaze then rests on her eyes, which are truly beautiful, “though they were brown, they seemed to be black because of the lashes, and they met your gaze openly, with an artless candour.” again, emma’s eyes, though beautiful, are deceptive; her suggestiveness is again brought about by the frankness of her gaze. just before charles leaves he finds emma languorously gazing out the window, like the lonely heroine from a romance novel; they search for his riding crop and their bodies brush together, much to her embarrassment. charles continues to visit the rouault farm and continues to meet emma, “she always went with him as far as the doorstep. waiting for them to bring his horse, she stood there by him. they had said goodbye, they had no more to say; the fresh air wrapped all about her, fondling the stray locks of hair at the nape of her neck, or tugging on the strings of her apron around her hips, fluttering them like streamers. one day, when it was thawing, the trees in the yard were oozing damp from their bark; the snow on the top of the sheds was melting. she was at the door, she went to fetch her parasol, she opened it. the parasol, made of marbled silk, as the sun came shining through it, spread shifting colours over the whiteness of her face. there she was smiling in the moist warmth of its shade; and you could hear the drops of water, one by one, falling on the taut fabric.” again, charles sees emma both sensuously in the fondling her stray locks of hair, but also as a kind of romantic heroine, almost angelic, with the obscured light of her parasol resting on her face. indeed their mutual silence reads like a romantic scene when two lovers are so brimming with emotion that they cannot speak to one another, yet we get the feeling that flaubert is subverting the romantic genre as perhaps the characters have nothing to say to each other, not because of a common passion, but because they have nothing in common and so literally have nothing to talk about. (note also the awkwardness of their first conversation when emma complains about the dreariness of farm life.) charles’s wife, however, does not take kindly to him visiting the rouault farm after learning about the farmer’s attractive daughter and in a pique of jealousy she beans him from visiting them. not long after this, we discover that the fortune which charles married his wife for didn’t actually exist, much of it being a figment in her imagination, presumably in order to obtain a husband. charles’s parents are irate, and not long after this she has a heart attack. too late charles realises she loved him after all, though, interestingly he never stops referring to her as the widow dubuc, which was her name before she married him and became madame bovary, thus in charles’s mind she was never really madame bovary. one consolation from her death is that pierre rouault visits charles and invites him to visit the farm again, he tells him about how he felt when his wife passed away (who he actually did love) and how charles must take hope and plan for the future, it is spring after all. charles arrives at the farm; “through the cracks in the wood, the sun cast long narrow strips of brightness that broke across the angles of furniture and trembled on the ceiling. flies, on the table, were crawling up the glasses left there, and buzzing at the bottom, drowning in the cider dregs. the daylight that came down the chimney, turning the soot on the fire-back to velvet, touched the cold cinders blue. emma was sewing, she wore no fichu on her bare shoulders you could see bare drops of sweat.” again, we are reminded of charles’s first meeting with emma when he observes her sewing, again the observation is loaded with suggestiveness, charles imbues the sunlight on the ceiling with his emotion, is trembles, just as charles is trembling with excitement at seeing emma after several months and the soot in the fireplace is turned to velvet something ugly is transformed into something in a mirage of daylight, which is again linked to emma via the colour blue which was the colour of the seal of the letter which brought them together and the colour of emma’s dress when they first meet. we begin to see flaubert’s patterns emerge, as intricate and delicate as emma’s hair-do, but if soot seen as velvet symbolises emma, then we wonder what this says about her. imagecharles eventually proposes, via emma’s father, and is accepted. charles doesn’t shine very well at the wedding, being naturally shy, and morning after the wedding night it is as if he is the bride who has lost his virginity. somewhat ominously, after ...</td>\n",

       "      <td>this is a great book, both as a thriller genre story that is exciting, and as a metafictional, literary, multi-layered classic exploring the bigger issues of being human.i've read this twice - this weekend and 40 years ago. it's the kind of book which is different every time you read it if you take a decade or two between readings. the first time for me was in the early 1970's. my thinking was black and white and i was marching for civil rights and against the vietnam war. i saw this book as one backing my beliefs that the establishment was evil since i was a radical leftist and i despised all adults over 30. i cried for mcmurphy and i blamed all real-life adults for being the same as nurse ratchet - pure evil - except for those adults who were leftists. adults stood for unjust and discriminatory law-and-order, which kept mainly rich white men wealthy and safe, while the rest of us, impoverished slaves and servants, had no rights. the strong against the weak, the rich against the poor, the privileged against the needy.it's 2012, and i see now the book is not as black and white as i thought. it's complex, nuanced, balanced and flawed. i've given it five stars because it's close to perfect in its structure, and it certainly is perfect in the exploration of the dual nature of people in general, that internal battle between our immature and destructive animal natures and our mostly equal desire for civilized, safe and dependable order. the head nurse is not evil, and mcmurphy is not a angelic righteous man. while the symbolism runs deep in the novel so that every main character represents an abstract facet of being human, the actual protagonists still read as very flesh and blood. it also is not a political book against being bourgeois, but rather, i think, a book that reluctantly acknowledges that for a healthy society both the impulses for ordinary self-control and lack of self-control are necessary for mental health. the drama takes place in a pressurized bottle, so the story is an overheated plot, but i think it is an accurate representation of the human impulses that swing real western societies back and forth between peaceful order and unsettling, disruptive, necessary change that often lead to progressive good.(view spoiler)[big nurse ratched is not the complete wretch and tyrant as i originally saw her, although without question her mania for procedure, control and power could easily have become terrible. but she wasn't insane, she had checks and balances on her authority and her methods did provide calm and repetitious days and peaceful sameness to the asylum's patients. a very restrictive homey, but sterile, family life, as it were. many found it helpful, which i missed in my first reading. the view of her as a ball-busting bitch came from some of the characters, but not all. i also missed the fact most of the inmates were not 'committed', so they were voluntarily under her care and could leave whenever they wanted. they were not unwilling captives, but genuinely fragile, mentally ill patients who had nothing to face the rigors of life. they needed to be in a mental hospital. the power she had over the schedule of their activities, which originally i thought of as horrific, i saw with this reading that in being mentally ill, the patients needed structure and no surprises, as well as a limited daily activity schedule. too many excitements and surprises did cause them much stress and harm. the real 'evil' of ratched rested in her power to shame the men. by a million small daily ways, she made them feel embarrassed and wretched to be themselves, magnifying their small, ordinary transgressions into horrific crimes. mcmurphy is the kind of guy most women would avoid. he was the male version of a ball buster, a cunt buster, if you will. he drank excessively, sought out bar fights, and was uneducated (although not illiterate). he had sex with a 15-year-old girl and he had been convicted of statutory rape. his first sexual intercourse was with a ten-year-old girl when he was nine. he won military awards serving in a war-time army, but got a dishonorable discharge. a woman looking for a good husband would not select him. on the other hand, he was a warm, friendly, honorable man who loved the mostly harmless side of youthful animal life - sex, drinking, partying, fishing, gambling. he was charismatic and a natural leader. for many of the male patients, because he was a man's man, and full of life, fun and vigor, they were able to trust him to a point and follow him which helped their self-confidence. he modeled male assertiveness and, most important for the patients, a complete lack of shame in his masculinity. he gave them the example of spitting in the eye of authority, a power which either they were unaware of or had too much fear of the consequences. and there were consequences.mcmurphy did not know he was a category of patient called 'committed'. he simply had not liked the prison where he was serving out a 6-month sentence. he faked being mentally ill in order to be moved to what he thought was a cushier imprisonment, and it was. he thought he was being clever gaming the system, and instead he discovered very late in his game that being 'committed' meant he could be locked up for life. under the 'committed' designation, he actually needed ratched's approval to be released. he also discovered that she had the authority to give him electric shock treatments, which scramble the brain's thoughts, or she could recommend to the supervisor the ultimate bad-behavior cure of a lobotomy if he broke enough rules to show the supervisor he was a danger to himself and others. to his regret, this was information about his commitment he uncovered late in the book.at first, he learned that a major part of ratched's job was to civilize the inmates into socially expected conformity and behavior. she had her own agenda of shaming them into the dirt, and he became determined to save the male patients from her authority. but as time passes, he learns the inmates really were limited by mental damage, as well as of ratched's considerable powers to punish. i missed the fact of the inmates genuine helplessness in society the first time i read this. i was reminded of the animal activists who released minks from a mink farm, only to have the consequence most of the minks died over a period of two weeks because they could not cope with their freedom.we see what occurs through the eyes of chief bromden, a 6'10\" native american who believes himself a weak midget. he sees schizophrenic imaginary images, but even now i'm uncertain if he was schizophrenic. he had a traumatic life of losses and the unmanning of his tribe, father and lifestyle, which in today's terms we'd call ptsd, and he served in a war-time army, plus the asylum had all of the patients under strong medications. he, i think, represents another older, conquered spent force of masculinity, a culture wiped out by modern western civilization. it's not unimportant that as a child bromden lives in a shack with his parents, his father a native american chief who fishes a river for salmon, and his mother a white woman, who convinces the tribe to sell out the property for money in order for white men to build an electricity-producing dam to stop the naturally flowing water and the fish and the life they enjoyed.through bromden's astute observations, the reader sees mcmurphy undergo a limited transformation when he understands what trouble he has caused himself by faking mental illness, and for awhile, he conforms. but it appears at a certain point, he refuses to continue conforming and reclaims his sense of who he is as a person. while mcmurphy sees himself as an untamed natural man and he is simply enjoying life, to the inmates, he is a masculine role model. to me, he is the literary force of male energy, yin, contending with the female force, yang, both forever fighting for supremacy within each of us whatever our sexual identity. ultimately, civilization wins because it is the strongest integrating force over all, but at the same time, the author, i think, shows that we need the yin/yang internal struggle of not conforming/conforming to become fully realized human beings. chief bromden recovers and escapes from the asylum and rejoins society, no longer emotionally stunted and crippled. but he is not a force of male nature as represented by the irresponsible peter pan man, mcmurphy, or the self-denying big nurse force of civilized-defined self-control. bromden is a whole integrated human being, cured, at the end.the ending, getting back to the book, is rushed. mcmurphy collapses too fast. however, given that he is drugged and undergoing est, given that bromden sees a few weeks before that mcmurphy himself realizes he's not going to win, ultimately it's close enough to believability. it always was a matter of who cracked first, and she had all the major weapons at her disposal. mcmurphy only had his self-love and irresponsible aggression. when a male patient dies because the two enemies interfere with with the geniune patient's fragile ability to survive, crushing him between their ideologies, it's the institution of civilized conformity that prevails. but the nurse is also impaired and crippled by the sudden experience of her own exposed fragility. she learns that the armor and protection of institutional conformity is an illusion maintained by the inmates respecting that paradigm of reality. in fact, conformity is a philosophy, given force only by the willingness of people to believe in it.  (hide spoiler)]my only quibble is the book most definitely comes off as anti-women, although how bad in that direction is arguable. most of classical literature and art uses the sexes to show opposing forces of nature: women are usually the force of simplicity, quiet maintenance of the status quo, creation, propagation or moral purity; men are symbolic usually of strength, power, authorit...</td>\n",

       "      <td>this is a classic for a reason. excellently written. i was completely transported to 1600s salem.this audiobook production was particularly fantastic.summary (spoilers):a puritan minister stumbles on a bunch of young girls and a slave woman doing \"magic\" in the woods, and many of the girls fall sick afterwards, presumably of guilt and embarrassment for doing something so \"sinful.\" word spreads, and the townspeople start to describe it as witchcraft. under pressure, the girls admit to witchcraft and start accusing others in the town, which gives them a power they begin to enjoy. several innocent people are killed. the main secret that is revealed is that john proctor had an affair with young abigail williams, and she had done a spell in the woods to kill mrs. proctor so that john would be free to join abigail. however, john is regretful of the affair. he tries to be a voice of reason amongst all the witchcraft accusations, but is eventually accused himself. he first admits to witchcraft so that he can take care of his children after his wife hangs, but he changes his mind, and reveals his affair as the reason abigail is accusing his wife. this doesn't work and retracts his admission of witchcraft and is killed. interesting to note that this play was written during the mccarthythism era.</td>\n",

       "      <td>“i descended a little on the side of that delicious vale, surveying it with a secret kind of pleasure, though mixed with my other afflicting thoughts, to think that this was all my own; that i was king and lord of all this country indefensibly, and had a right of possession; and if i could convey it, i might have it in inheritance as completely as any lord of a manor in england.”so, has the island got robinson, or has robinson got the island? this was one of the two questions i kept asking myself throughout the whole novel, the other being, whether defoe ever took the trouble to read over the first draught of his novel over in order to smooth out its rough edges and make it more palatable because there are quite some passages that stick out as badly written. however, these might be put down not so much to defoe as a writer but rather to his main character crusoe as a chronicler [1].it is quite strange that it took me 47 years before i took this classic tale in hand and read it from cover to cover, but then defoe himself was already in his 59th year when he wrote this book, which was his first novel ever. i expected a tale of adventure, but instead got a lecture on economics in that crusoe makes lists and calculations of everything, even of the cannibals he slays. to the last farthing, he lays open his business affairs, and there is thrift in whatever he does even before he lands on his island. for example, when in his first adventure, he manages to escape moorish slaveholders with the help of a little boy called xury, and is picked up by a portuguese ship, we get this:”he [i.e. the portuguese captain, t.s.] offered me also sixty pieces of eight more for my boy xury, which i was loth to take; not that i was unwilling to let the captain have him, but i was very loth to sell the poor boy’s liberty, who had assisted me so faithfully in procuring my own. however, when i let him know my reason, he owned it to be just, and offered me this medium, that he would give the boy an obligation to set him free in ten years, if he turned christian: upon this, and xury saying he was willing to go to him, i let the captain have him.”later, we are treated to lots of examples of how robinson crusoe, who is very lucky to procure material, powder, guns, seeds and other stuff from the stranded ship, improves his personal situation on the island. in order to economize on gunpowder, he catches, tames and breeds goats from which he derives a comfortable supply of ready meat and milk, and, prior to that, he also starts farming. a lot of the fascination of the book lies in witnessing the protagonist getting a comfortable life for himself through foresight, inventiveness and – what’ probably most important – tenacity. the latter is important in that he does not have all the tools he needs and so often has to help himself with the most primitive makeshift solutions, whose appliance to a task requires both patience and doggedness. crusoe’s readiness to exploit any opportunity with methodical determination –”i believe verily, had the calm weather held, i should have brought away the whole ship, piece by piece” –is the key to his survival, and probably also the main point defoe wants to make. james joyce sees in crusoe”the true prototype of th british colonist […]. the whole anglo-saxon spirit is in crusoe: the manly independence; the unconscious cruelty; the slow yet efficient intelligence; the sexual apathy; the practical, well-balanced religiousness; the calculating taciturnity”, and one feels inclined to agree with him in this: robinson crusoe is a manifest of middle-class capitalism, and would a tax advisor or an accounting clerk be cast away on a remote island, the result would probably be the same. the book’s down-to-earth, prosaic undercurrent can be seen quite early, in the father’s advice to his adventurous son:”he told me it was men of desperate fortunes on one hand, or of aspiring, superior fortunes on the other, who went abroad upon adventures, to rise by enterprise, and make themselves famous in undertakings of a nature out of the common road; that these things were all either too far above me or too far below me; that mine was the middle state, or what might be called the upper station of low life, which he had found, by long experience, was the best state in the world, the most suited to human happiness, not exposed to the miseries and hardships, the labour and sufferings of the mechanic part of mankind, and not embarrassed with the pride, luxury, ambition, and envy of the upper part of mankind. he told me i might judge of the happiness of this state by this one thing—viz. that this was the state of life which all other people envied; that kings have frequently lamented the miserable consequence of being born to great things, and wished they had been placed in the middle of the two extremes, between the mean and the great; that the wise man gave his testimony to this, as the standard of felicity, when he prayed to have neither poverty nor riches.”this may seem utterly boring and homespun, but i must confess that following crusoe in his solitary fight for survival, and his steady attempts at mastering an indifferent nature was extremely appealing to me. much more so than listening to my tax advisor. it may also be said that defoe is at his best as long as crusoe is on his own, trying to improve his dwelling, build a boat or plan his cultivation of the arable land he creates, while as soon as other people arrive on the scene, the writing gets incredibly dull, like a tax advisor’s might when he tries to write a play. practically all the other characters, with the exception of friday, remain nameless, and they are all, without an exception, anaemic and lifeless.it cannot be otherwise but that a man as much concerned with his own affairs – which is, to a certain extent quite understandable seeing that this man has stranded on an uninhabited island – will find to religion through the reflexion that whatever has happened to him has been ordained by god in order to make him realize the power and mercy his maker. it’s not a feeling of being overwhelmed by the vastness and bounty of creation that makes crusoe adopt a more zealous stance towards christianity but, like jonah, the conviction that whatever happened to him was a hint of god, who, for some reason or other, had got it into his head to make robinson crusoe from the city of york believe in him and adore him.one need not live on an island to be one, but it surely helps.[1] for example, we get a large part of the story told twice, once through the ex post report by robinson crusoe to his readers, and then in the form of the diary he kept on the island, which is also inserted in the report and gives an account of things that have already been covered in depth – and length. luckily for the reader, crusoe’s ink supplies ran out eventually, and he saw no way of making any more ink on his own. also, the end of the story – or the first part, because defoe also wrote a sequel – is maybe postponed a bit too much, for friday’s encounter with the bear is one of the least convincing incidents in the whole book and does not contribute to its main idea.</td>\n",

       "      <td>i was reminded of lolita when i read a clockwork orange. the primary male characters in both stories are repugnant and in both there are huge moral transgressions to be disgusted by. but yet both books are classics. with lolita it is the storytelling and the prose. in clockwork it is the alternative reality that anthony burgess creates, close enough to real life that it’s not really sci-fi. i should mention that his use of first person was dramatic. he makes heavy use of over two hundred (sometimes russian influenced) words that are either completely made up or borrowed directly such as devotchka for girl or rot for mouth. in doing so he creates a vibe to the book that is reminiscent of cyberpunk introduced some twenty years later in gibson’s necromancer. it is the murderous thug alex, the main character, and his band of misfits running around beating people to death and raping women that is so shocking. much of this happens early in the book so initially we don’t get to know the characters other than through this lens of violent behavior. but later we see alex abandoned by some of his minions and we see alex beaten often by the millicents (police) for reasons little better than his own rampages. there is at least a consistent thematic element to show alex doesn’t really get away with his transgressions at least in the cosmic order of things. in the intro, burgess said he wrote this book as titillation and is a little embarrassed by this being the work that he is most remembered by since he otherwise had a very productive and successful career as an author and screen play writer. in fact the version that i read had a very lengthy section of his accomplishments just to drive this point home.so is young alex rehabilitated? it depends somewhat on whether you read the british version and its twenty-one chapters or the american version, which the film was based on, and which lacks the final redeeming chapter. i can say that, for me, the significance of the redemption chapter in the british version did not play a critical role in how i view this book. i felt the final chapter a little shallow, consistent with much of the book. the intricacy of the plot or lack thereof, was not a differentiating point for me either. nonetheless there is a ton of genius in burgess’ approach here that makes this classic especially thought provoking.five stars with some reservations</td>\n",

       "      <td>i first read this several years ago, around 2003 i think, while i was living in japan. i remember really struggling to read the first chapter, which is the narrator's description and explanation of a character called robert cohn. i don't know why i had so much trouble reading it, just that i couldn't follow it, couldn't keep track of it. it wasn't a good way to start. then, i was hoping right up to the last page for a happy ending. i felt cheated that i didn't get it. kind of like \"why the hell did i read this then?\" this time around (reading it again for a book club - i missed the meeting, incidentally), because i knew what to expect, i could focus on all the other things in the novel, knowing that the narrator, jake, would still be alone at the end of it. that he wouldn't get to keep brett. and i had no trouble reading the first chapter. really, the prose is incredibly easy to read, simplistic even, except for when the descriptions get vague.but i'm getting ahead of myself.set in 1924, fiesta is the story of jake, an american living and working in paris, who goes to pamplona in spain to see the bull fighting with some friends, a mix of american and english ex-pats - one of which is brett, lady ashley, a beautiful and charismatic woman of 34 who's waiting for her divorce to come through so she can marry a bankrupt, mike campbell. jake and brett met during the war, when he was recovering from an injury. they fell in love, but his injury was of the groin variety so they can't be physically together - hence, she doesn't want to stay with him even though she loves him. instead, she has casual relationships and affairs, while jake has to watch. sometimes he even introduces them. but there's nothing he can do about it.the story is heavily detailed with the kind of descriptions that, while apparently perfectly acceptable in classics and other works of literature, can be the cause of some rather heavy criticism in genre fiction. like so:\"i unpacked my bags and stacked the books on the table beside the head of the bed, put out my shaving things, hung up some clothes in the big armoire, and made up a bundle for the laundry. then i took a shower in the bathroom and went down to lunch.\" (p.207)it would be petty of me to ask, where else would he take a shower? wouldn't it. shame.this book is all prose, very little plot. it's not that it's wordy, rather that it reads like a mouth full of crooked, over-crowded teeth. the dialogue is very 20s-specific, and if i was the kind of reviewer who liked to write snappy, witty, clever little reviews, the first thing i'd do is satirise the dialogue. like so:\"i feel so rotten!\" brett said.\"don't be a damned fool,\" jake said.\"the count's a brick.\"\"let's have a drink.\"\"here's the pub.\"\"this is a hell of a place,\" bill said.\"why don't you see when you're not wanted, cohn? go away. take that sad jewish face away,\" said mike.\"i feel like hell. don't let's talk,\" said brett.\"it's been damned hard on mike.\"\"do you still love me jake?\" asked brett.\"yes.\"\"because i'm a goner. i'm in love with the bullfighting boy.\"\"it's been damned hard on mike.\"\"where's that beer?\" mike asked.and so on. a lot of repetition, a lot of drunken mouthing off, a lot of really very pointless, empty conversation that goes round and round in circles. the problem is, of course, that the characters are all horrible, shallow, self-interested, boorish, ill-mannered, childish tourists, the kind that make you cringe. jake is probably the only character you can feel any real sympathy for, but even he has his moments. as the first-person narrator, it's amazing how little we know jake's thoughts. he hides behind recounting pointless dialogue and describing mundane things. there are times when he gets thoughtful, wistful even, and those parts are what make the novel worthwhile. it's also very easy to feel like you're in paris, and spain. the heavily descriptive prose does help create a realistic, breathing setting. especially when they reach pamplona, to watch the bull-fighting. it just also happens to be the place where their behaviour becomes even more embarrassing.i'm not sure if hemingway was criticising his fellow ex-pats or not - but i think he is. maybe he was just describing it how it was - and it is believable. jake isn't a judgemental character, but i wonder how much of that is jake and how much hemingway? this edition doesn't come with any additional notes or introductions or appendices, so i haven't read anything about the novel that might shed light on this. as a chronicle of ex-pat life, especially among those who have money, in the 20s, and of bull-fighting, it's a success. but it's still two-dimensional. as for the bull-fighting, it's one of the more interesting sections, especially towards the end where there's an involved recounting of three bull-fighters at work. we now know that bull's are red-green colour-blind; it's the movement of the cape that enrages them, not the colour. so i wonder what was wrong with the bull jake assumed was colour-blind?as simplistic as i've made this novel sound, there is quite a lot going on in the details, things that make it both interesting and deplorable. the bull fighting, for instance, is both a commemoration and a presentation of a highly controversial topic. there's certainly a parallel between the beauty and brutality of the bull-fighting, and the way these ex-pats treat each other. they are at once unlikeable, and likeable. it just goes to show how confounding humans can be, and how contradictory.</td>\n",

       "      <td>the most difficult thing about reading fyodor dostoyevsky is pronouncing his name i think. the first dostoyevsky book i read was crime and punishment, i liked it well enough even though it was dark and sad and generally something of a downer. the brothers karamazov is also dark and sad yet there is an element of optimism in it. if you are attempting dostoyevsky for the first time crime and punishment is probably the easier option, being less dense, complex and simply shorter. actually having read these two books i believe dostoyevsky (translated) is not that hard to read, he was not one of those experimental postmodern authors that will have you scratching your head trying to decipher his prose and narrative structure. that said the brothers karamazov is a profound and psychologically complex novel, there are at least a couple of chapters which entirely consist of philosophical or even mystical digressions.at the most basic level the brothers karamazov is exactly what it says on tin, that is a story of brothers of the karamazov family. three of them (and possibly a bonus one). dmitri, the wild one who seems to specialize in digging his own grave, ivan the overthinking intellectual, and alyosha, the pious one. none of them were raised by their father fyodor pavlovich karamazov, who is clearly one of the all-time worst dads in fiction. the novel explores how such a shabby, unloving upbringing shape the three brothers in different ways.the narrative gradually transforms from a story of the development of the three brothers into a murder mystery followed by a courtroom drama. however, the intent is not to thrill but to explore the psychology of the main characters and the consequence of their actions. if this sounds like a drag i can assure you that it is not, most of the book is quite gripping and thought provoking. that said if you are looking for a thriller you would have to look elsewhere.the three brothers and practically all the characters in this book are very vividly drawn by dostoyevsky. i believe the most remarkable achievement is the characterization of alexei fyodorovich karamazov (a.k.a. alyosha) who is the heart and soul of the book. “nice” characters are very hard to write, especially as a protagonist, they tend to be less colorful than other characters and often downright bland. for example harry potter is hardly the most compelling character in the series named after him, his teachers, friends and enemies are much more interesting and fun to read about. dostoyevsky has somehow managed to make alyosha a complex, interesting and compelling in spite of not having a single mean bone in his body.the other two brothers are no less compelling. dimitri’s actions and eventual fate is a great illustration of what tend to happen when the head rules the heart, his wild “love crazed fool” behavior is often embarrassing undignified, and he ends up being something of a train wreck. ivan is intellectual to the point of pretentiousness, this also works out badly for him. alyosha, on the other hand, has an uncanny ability to shame the very worst people with his incorruptible goodness and extract goodness from them. there is also the dastardly yet pitiful smerdyakov who is probably an uncredited karamazov, he reminds me of dickens’ uriah heep (from [book; david copperfield]).the novel extols the value of honor, self-sacrifice, forgiveness and redemption, but above all love and understanding. i am certainly sold on these themes, by the time i finished the brothers karamazov i wanted to hug everybody.as usual for me with the classics, i “read” it on audiobook over several weeks (a couple of months with this one). also as usual, i am a total skinflint and opted for the free librivox version. this is book is read by quite a few volunteers, some are better than others but at least all of their reading is understandable. i you do not want to pay $20+ for an audible.com professional reading this is the way to go (there are of course other, rather nefarious ways to obtain audiobooks but i won’t mention those!).</td>\n",

(or at least, i'm assuming he's gay. he spends the entire book calling \"i\" \"baby\" and asking him for kisses and this does not mean cheek kisses, y'all). except he's also very into women. so. is he bi? is he just really troubled? is this a really bad impression of italians? hemingway either: 1) doesn't know or 2) doesn't care.speaking of italians: hemingway informs us that \"i\" doesn't know how to spell in italian. this is a clever ruse to disguise the fact that hemingway himself doesn't know how to spell in italian. as someone who knows a bit of the language and definitely how to spell some of the common words, i cringed every time they spoke in italian. because. he mispelled \"hi\" in italian. how does one even do that. i know hemingway has been lauded as a brilliant writer and i know it's a different time period. i'm going to try not to bring fitzgerald into this review even though i could sing about how much i love fitzgerald's writing style for at least a year. the writing style sucks okay. it really does. it's flat and uninspired and this guy has no clue how to use commas or dialogue tags. so half the time i had no clue who was talking and i just skimmed conversations (which is fine, they're literally all extraneous) because i couldn't keep up. how does one get away with writing like that? howwww????!!!!!also, can i just mention: i had no idea that americans in the italian army were as rich as they were, or that they had to do as little fighting in world war one as this guy did, because he'd never been in combat before getting his leg badly injured, and i swear he had so much money he never needed to work another day in his life. his girlfriend really just stayed with him for the money, i think. he literally bought a cabin in the mountains in switzerland and drank to excess at swiss bars every single day and he never worked and never got paid. like...how.i could write an entire review about hemingway's characters' view of women, but for right now, let's just say: he writes women like they're the worst (probably because he only knew flappers and they were kind of troubled), and his male characters are so obsessed with women that i was embarrassed to the point of literal actual tears at one point. that's right, y'all. this book literally made me cry from anger. because these men...my goodness. the women are objects. we're at war so that we can sleep with all the girls who come along. these two innocent, small, helpless girls who need help escaping the german advance in italy? man, i wish we weren't so busy retreating...if we weren't heaven knows we'd be cheering our luck about finding a couple of virgins on the side of the road. (please note: these two girls were fourteen and fifteen.) also the romantic relationship was entirely built off codependency and cruelty and this is not love, people. it genuinely isn't. \"am i a good girl?\" \"please tell me i'm doing well. i just want to please you.\" \"the rain doesn't change how much you love me, does it?\" \"i'm so fat because i'm pregnant and i think you probably don't love me anymore because i'm not thin and exciting anymore\" &lt;----actual lines from the main girl in this book. please. please. someone bleach my eyes because blargh.i will write about this in english class because i have to. but i'm saying this right now: i never want to have to read hemingway again. and i can find nothing good about this story. you heard that. nothinggggggggg. i could rant for a very long time, but oh well. we're doing great. 1 star and please, spare yourself from ever having to read this book. if you have read it: i pity you, poor soul. better luck next time.faith out. have a great day :d</td>\n",

       "      <td>(reprinted from the chicago center for literature and photography [cclapcenter.com:]. i am the original author of this essay, as well as the owner of cclap; it is not being reprinted here illegally.)the cclap 100: in which i read a hundred so-called \"classics\" for the first time, then write reports on whether or not they deserve the labelbook #17: a farewell to arms, by ernest hemingway (1929)the story in a nutshell:published in the late 1920s, right when modernism was first starting to become a commercially successful form of the arts, a farewell to arms is ernest hemingway's wry and cynical look at world war i, the event that most defined not only his generation but also the beginning of the modernist movement. semi-autobiographical in nature, the book tells the story of frederic henry, known to most as \"tenente\" (italian slang for \"lieutenant\"), a young and gung-ho american who couldn't get accepted by the american military during the war, so volunteered to be an ambulance driver for the italian army instead. one of the first of hemingway's tales to define the stoic \"man's man\" he would eventually become known for, the novel basically follows tenente through a series of thrilling escapades, made even more interesting because of the main character not seeing them as thrilling at all -- nearly having his leg torn off while at the front, saving a man's life, escaping execution by diving off a bridge, a rowboat ride to switzerland in the middle of the night while fleeing a group of pursuers, and a whole lot more.like i said, though, hemingway's point here is not to glamorize war, but rather to highlight the mundane aspects of it all; the endless red tape, the weasely things people do to get out of actual work, the bs conversations that are always taking place among soldiers, all of them arguing over how the war is going but none of them actually possessing any factual information. at the same time, though, a farewell to arms is about the monstrous developments of world war i in particular, the very first large war to be fought during the industrial age, and therefore capable of inflicting so much more carnage than anyone thought possible. (for example, the brand-new european railway system is heavily featured throughout the book, and especially the fact that in a half-day's ride, you could go literally from the battlefront to a five-star luxury hotel, something that had never been possible before wwi.) oh, and if all this wasn't enough, hemingway throws in a love story too, a complicated one featuring a complicated woman, one that has been a source of heated interpretation since the book first came out 79 years ago.the argument for it being a classic:there seems to be two main arguments for this being a classic, one based on the author and one on the book itself. because the fact is that hemingway is considered by many to be one of the most important novelists in the history of that format, a fabled \"high priest of modernism\" who taught all of us to think in a punchier, shorter way, and with this mostly being for the better for the arts in general. because let's not forget, a mere twenty or thirty years before this book was first published, it was actually the flowery and overwritten victorian style of literature that dominated the publishing industry; and as we've all learned throughout the course of this \"cclap 100\" essay series, although victorian literature certainly has its charms and inherent strengths, it's also a whole lot of talking to say not much at all, a situation that was starting to drive artists crazy by the time the 20th century got into swing. hemingway, fans claim, was the first modernist to really bring all the details together in a profoundly great way -- the first to combine the exciting rat-a-tat style of pulp-fiction writers with the weighty subjects of the academic community, producing work that owes as much to raymond chandler as it does to virginia woolf but is ultimately much better than simply reading those two authors back-to-back. and by making its subject world war i, fans say, hemingway here turns in yet another great document of those times that the early modernists were known for -- from the great gatsby to all quiet among the western front, it's hard for us to even think of the artists from the \"jazz age\" or \"lost generation\" or whatever you want to call it, without thinking of this globe-changing event that was so in the middle of it. there's a good reason, after all, that many consider a farewell to arms one of the greatest war novels of all time.the argument against:of course, there are others who can't even hear the words \"ernest hemingway\" without automatically shuddering, again for a variety of reasons that even most of his fans admit hold at least some weight -- because he is overrated by the academic community, because his personal style is a hackneyed, easily parodied one, because his \"man's man\" shtick got real old real fast, because it's now inspired three generations of a--holes (and counting) to want to be bull-fleeing, cigar-smoking woman-haters too. at its heart, its critics say, a farewell to arms is an interesting-enough little ditty, mostly because hemingway himself had some interesting little experiences during the war that he basically cribbed wholesale for the book; but then this story is covered with layer after layer of bad prose, macho posturing, and aimless meanderings that get you about as far away from a traditional three-act novel as you can possibly get. with hemingway and his critics, it's never a case of \"it's a good enough book but shouldn't be labeled a classic;\" those who dislike him really dislike him, and wish to see his work removed from academic reading lists altogether. \"classic\" label or not.my verdict:so let me embarrassingly admit that this is actually the very first book by hemingway i've ever read, and that i was hesitant going into it because of just the overwhelming amount of bad stuff that's been said about him over the decades; to be truthful, i was half-expecting a parody of hemingway at this point, all little words and nonsensical sentences and dudes treating girls kinda like crap most of the time. and yes, the book does for sure contain a certain amount of all this; but i was surprised, to tell you the truth, by how how tight, illuminating, fascinating and just plain funny a farewell to arms turned out to actually be. wait, funny, you say? sure; i dare you not to laugh, for example, during the scene when a huge argument breaks out between two swiss border guards over which of their two hometowns boasts better winter sports. (\"ah, you see? he does not even know what a luge is!\") this is what makes it such an intriguing novel about war, after all, because hemingway expertly shows just how many surreal moments there are during times of war as well, that \"war\" doesn't just mean the two lines of soldiers facing each other at the front but also an entire region, an entire industry, an entire population. hemingway's world war i is not just seen from the smeared windshield of a battlefront ambulance, but from bored soldiers getting drunk in a quiet bunker, from weary villagers hoping there will be at least something left of their homes after the war is over, from armchair pundits recovering in crumbling veteran hospitals, arguing over which complicated international treaty sunk them all and which is going to save them. it's an expansive, multi-facted, sometimes highly unique look at a wartime environment, one that at least here in his early career (he published this when he was 30) belies all the complaints that have ever been made about his hackneyed personal style.and as far as that love story in the middle of it all, and the repeated complaints about hemingway's characters all being misogynists...well, maybe it was just me, but i found his catherine barkley to be the very model of a modern independent woman (or at least modern and independent in 1920s terms), a fiercely intelligent and cynical creature who expects the same from her lovers, even while realizing that such a man is destined to either die in the environment they're currently in, or survive just to become a bitter, angry a--hole later in life. the way i see it, catherine is simply trying to make the best of a bad situation; she needs love and intimacy in her life as much as anyone else, and especially in her role as a risk-taking, thick-skinned nurse just a few miles from the battle's front, but also understands that tenente is destined to befall one of the two fates just mentioned, thus explaining the curious push/pull emotions she has towards him and the way she treats him throughout the novel. it's a surprisingly sophisticated relationship at work, the same thing that can be said of the novel in general; i don't know about the rest of hemingway's work (yet, anyway), but at least a farewell to arms turned out to be a surprisingly cracking read, not only a definite classic but just an all-around amazing book in general. it comes highly recommended today.is it a classic? yes</td>\n",

       "      <td>a powerful, important message in a weak novel! as a classic, harriet beecher stowe's uncle tom's cabin deserves its status as a powerful indictment against the history of black slavery in america. with courage and insight unprecedented in her time, stowe uses moving family tales of a number of black and white families to pillory the violence and hatred to which blacks were subjected prior to the american civil war and thrills the reader with convincing philosophical debates that reveal the astonishing hypocrisy and weak-willed rationalizations that the white population used to justify their actions. stowe's frank, terrifyingly banal and utterly unabashed presentation of slavery, slave trading, white attitudes and the laws of the ante-bellum us southern states will turn most modern readers red and shame-faced with embarrassment that these events actually form a part of their country's heritage. but, as a novel, uncle tom's cabin is unsatisfying, overly long and poorly edited. stowe's insistence on writing her dialogue in a faux black english dialect is unconvincing at best and is actually often irritating and distracting as it becomes more and more difficult to decipher what her characters are actually trying to say. her insistence on preaching and using christian church teachings and the bible as the primary basis for criticizing prejudice, racism and slavery frankly grated my sensibilities. there is plenty enough wrong with slavery and its history in america from a purely humanist point of view without resorting to what would be categorized as \"bible thumping\" today. (that said, i will admit that it may have been an appropriate approach to convince what she saw as her potential audience at the time). the white characters she uses to support and convey her message of understanding, compassion and her political agenda of abolition are so sugary sweet as to be positively cloying. a scene in which her primary white character, evangeline st clare, gathers her family and her family's slaves around her death bed in order to distribute locks of her hair to one and all was so melodramatic and pointless as to approach the level of bizarre. i would never say to any potential future reader that i enjoyed uncle tom's cabin. i didn't! in fact, at times, it was even a struggle to finish it. but the message, the history, the overwhelming importance and the power of the arguments conveyed by the story are more than enough reason to read it anyway. if enough people take the message to heart then perhaps the world has a possibility of avoiding repetition of events like the holocaust, the rwandan genocide, the rape of nanking or the slaughter of the muslims in bosnia by the serbs. paul weiss</td>\n",

                                                                               margaret atwood immediately lets the reader know that there is no balm in gilead, not even in the form of hand lotion to smooth a woman's hands roughened by physical labor. atwood's dystopian novel of a theocratic government in what was formerly the united states of america is a reflection of fierce feminism shared by the most outspoken women of the time protesting the sexual exploitation and domination of women by men, particularly through the pornographic industry.\"the handmaid's tale\" illustrates the position of andrea dworkin, katherine mackinnon,dianna russell, and others that the sexual exploitation of women through pornography or prostitution serves as causation for violence against women.the sex positive feminist of today might well read \"the handmaid's tale\" in a different light than when it was published in 1986. candida royalle and tristan taormino, among others, most likely would have the attitude, \"it can't happen here.\"atwood's novel, told by offred, remains a compelling story of male domination of women. the subjugation of women through the use of a theocratic form of government remains within the realm of possibility. consider the warnings of muslim clerics this week that women being allowed to drive in saudi arabia would result in the decline or disappearance of virginity.in atwood's tale, a right wing fundamentalist group, the sons of jacob, take over the american government following a staged islamic attack on washington, d.c., in an event that becomes known as the massacre of the president. america becomes known as \"gilead,\" meaning \"hill of justice,\" or \"mound of witness.\"caught in an endless war reminiscent of that in \"1984,\" gilead begins to experience more serious problems that will affect its very existence. more and more women are becoming sterile, or, not that the men will admit it, somethings gone seriously wrong with sperm count.women who have shown themselves capable of producing children are imprisoned and given the term handmaids. their children are adopted by couples in positions of authority. handmaids are assigned to gilead officials for the purpose of procreating the species. these potential mothers are robbed of their identity and known by the patronymic of the official to whom they are assigned.\"tht\" is especially riveting in that it is told in the present tense in the first person by one handmaid assigned to the commandant fred. hence, we know her only as \"offred.\" the use of tense and voice lend to the tension of the plot as this technique leaves the outcome completely unknown.offred gives us only the slightest glimpse of her personal appearance. she stands 5'7\", she tells us, as she catches a glimpse of herself in a mirror.once a month, offred participates in a ritual, lying back against the body of the commandant's wife, serena joy, a former televangelist, as fred attempts to impregnate her. offred's perception is that she is not the victim of rape as she has consented to perform this duty. the fact that had she failed to fulfill this role would have resulted in her being placed in a house of prostitution, or even worse, banishment to the colonies, for burial of the war dead or clearing of toxic waste does not seem to dawn on her.however, fred is not content to leave his relationship at a monthly ritual. he has offred sent to his library where he asks her to play a game of scrabble with him. such fraternization is prohibited. nor are women allowed reading material.initially, the commandant presents as a somewhat poignant figure, desiring the companionship of a woman with a mind. more so, the commandant appears to miss the idea of intimate companionship. however, fred loses any appearance worthy of sympathy when he smuggles offred into a brothel, passing her off as a woman hired for the night. even within the most strict theocracy the forbidden fruit is the most sweet.offred's flashbacks to the time before are particularly heartbreaking. she was married, in love, and a mother of a five year old girl. the coming of gilead's dictatorship is evident. offred, her husband luke, and their child attempt to escape by taking a supposed picnic. the outcome is inevitable. offred loses her husband, her child, and herself.offred's relationship with her mother is particularly interesting. her mother was a classic feminist of the 1970s. this was a time that \"our bodies ourselves\" was practically required reading in college women's studies classes. her mother was a participant at the first \"take back the night\" observances. it should be noted that take back the night was originally associated with the feminist anti-pornography movement, before it became more widely associated with sexual assault prevention.offred was actually embarrassed by her mother's outspoken nature. she would have preferred her mother to be more like her contemporaries' mothers. one wonders how she felt about her mother's attitudes after the societal controls of gilead were in place.against offred's self-portrait, offred presents her stronger, rebellious friend moira. moira was never one to follow convention, even in the freer days of pre-gilead america. moira's actions after the theocratic takeover are in direct opposition to offred's. moira attempts escape, defies authority, and remains resistant emotionally, though she complies outwardly with the demands made of her. nevertheless, she is still free in comparison to offred.offred's compliance with authority at times is frustrating. the reader may lose patience with her lack of resistance. yet, she is in a different situation than moira. she does have a child. perhaps it is the dimmest hope that she might one day be reunited with that child that accounts for her lack of active resistance.but the severity of gilead's dealing with failure to comply must also be factored in to offred's inaction. those deemed unacceptable to the policies of gilead are salvaged, that is, executed. their bodies are hung on hooks on display as a constant reminder of the consequences for disobedience.as should be expected, for every dictatorship, there is an active resistance. it is through this resistance that offred eventually achieves her escape.the ultimate downfall of gilead is not revealed by atwood. however, we know that it occurs. we also know that offred's tale is discovered and told. in the ultimate denouement of tht, the authenticity of offred's tale is debated at an anthropological conference. a male scholar lectures that a fellow scholar had dubbed the story the handmaid's tale after the fashion of chaucer's canterbury tales. at one point the lecturer refers to offred's story as the question of the handmaid's \"tail.\" atwood offers no solace that gender equality will ever be achieved.while one may question offred's courage, i suggest that enduring the unbearable to ultimately serve as a witness to evil is a form of courage in and of itself. to borrow a bit from faulkner, offred not only endured, she prevailed. ultimately atwood's message to each of us is that we have a choice to accept gender bias, or attempt to stop it. offred inspires me to stop it.     \n",

already.”it's 2019, and that quote is more true than it's ever been. it's truly terrifying to read a book in which some things are so real, that for a moment you don't know which reality is yours. sure, our food isn't rationed and we have enough razors for shaving, but the collective mindset is very much the same. if only orwell knew how prophetic his book turned out to be. he meant it as a warning, but it tuned out to be more of a manual. the idea of newspeak is especially funny to me, because although it isn't called that - english language nowadays is definitely at a stage that is more slang than an actual language. and it's only getting worse with years. i mean if we already add words such as \"selfie\" \"derp\" and most embarrassingly \"twerk\" into the oxford dictionary, what is next? no, no, don't tell me, it's too horrible even to imagine. “but if thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought.”with the social media being the monster it currently is, we long forgotten any right or even need for privacy. people catalog everything about themselves on the web - engagements, weddings, births, divorces. nothing is secret, nothing is sacred anymore. and the worst part? we enjoy doing it. we enjoy sharing. we tell ourselves we share, so our relatives in other states, or countries, can see it, but in reality we all pine for likes. for some stranger to adore our lives, to think that we have it so good. “power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing.”​i never had to read 1984 in high school, i didn't grow up in the united states, but i know many of you did. i am surprised that this book was only only allowed, but required for reading. this book is a mirror for many current political and economical tactics and machinations. but maybe we are too comfortable to listen. maybe the horrible things that happened to winston are too bizarre for our pampered and spoiled minds? if not for the many info-dumps, this book unfortunately (writing wise) subjects the reader to, i'd have given it 5 stars. 1984 is brilliant. scary so. it also doesn't read like a classic. for being written in 1949, it's very modern (albeit boring at times) in its language and execution of ideas on paper. having never read this book before, i didn't know what to expect from the plot, but there was no happy ending. and if we aren't careful, we might end up just like winston, drinking bad alcohol, starting mutely at a tv screen and believing everything the \"big brother\" tells us. “being in a minority, even in a minority of one, did not make you mad. there was truth and there was untruth, and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world, you were not mad.”my websitemy

years have already written about this classic american novel. i read the book because it is one \"those books\" which i should have read a long time ago but never did. it belongs in a category of books i am embarrassed to say i never got around to reading and should have. well now i have and i have to say i am rather disappointed. as i reflect on this feeling i realize it is unfair. it is a good book and definitely worth the time to read but i guess i'd have to say it hasn't aged well. when it published in 1953 the cold war was at its height, mccarthyism was raging, stalin had died but the extent of his evil was first coming to light. the timelines of fahrenheit 451 was clearly going to make it a book that would resonate with a public desperately trying to cope with a new and frightening world. i can easily see how this book would claim a deserved place in modern american literature. however, that was 1953 and this is 2019 and the book and its story are known to most if not all literate people. reading the book now, therefore, doesn't come with any surprises or revelations as the story is too well known. it can be appreciated for the author's artfulness and imagination but the images he created no longer carry the same impact they might have had in decades past. if there was anything that did impress me it was his imagining of wall sized televisions and people mesmerized by their television shows and the resulting loss of human interaction that results from the attachments to these electronic devices. i wish he were still alive to deal with this issue as it exists today. sadly, he is gone but at least he left us with this book. this is a work of serious significance in literature that while a bit dated still has some worth to the contemporary reader.    \n",

                                     a dark, enlightening, addictive dystopia“it was a pleasure to burn.”in ray bradbury’s 1953 dystopian classic, “fahrenheit 451,” guy montag is a “fireman” tasked with tracking down books and burning them, typically by incinerating the “perpetrator’s” dwelling as well. encounters with the free-thinking teenager clarisse mcclellan are what begin to rip away his view of the world. until she mysteriously disappears.“the girl? she was a time bomb. the family had been feeding her subconscious, i’m sure, from what i saw of her school record. she didn’t want to know how a thing was done, but why. that can be embarrassing. you ask why to a lot of things and you wind up very unhappy indeed, if you kept at it. the poor girl’s better off dead.”meanwhile, montag’s wife and her friends are obsessed with their “family” in the “telescreen,” what would be equivalent today to america’s obsession with reality tv. after an elderly woman allows herself to burn with her home (and her books), and with clarisse gone, mildred out of touch, montag turns to a former english professor named faber to rationalize his life. the idea expressed is that books are a collection of human thought, which can be dangerous.“do you know why books such as this are so important? because they have quality. and what does the word quality mean? to me it means texture. this book has pores. it has features. this book can go under the microscope. you’d find life under the glass, streaming past in infinite profusion…the good writers touch life often. the mediocre ones run a quick hand over her. the bad ones rape her and leave her for the flies.”faber and montag concoct a plan to take down the firemen until their world comes crashing down, and montag is forced to run for his life.the bleak denouement mr. bradbury depicts has not (yet) come to pass. interestingly, it’s the underlying theme of the erosion of creativity and intelligence, especially as it relates to america’s obsession with tv, which seems more prescient. for instance, according to nielsen, americans over the age of 2 spend an average of 34 hours/week watching live tv and another 6 hours/week watching taped tv, while usa today reports that 1 in 7 american adults cannot understand their fuel bill, much less a news article, or, unfortunately, wonderful metaphors like this:“it doesn’t matter what you do, he said, so long as you change something from the way it was before you touched it into something that’s like you after you take your hands away. the difference between the man who just cuts lawns and a real gardener is in the touching, he said. the lawn-cutter might just as well not have been there at all; the gardener will be there a lifetime.”the bottom line: explore. ask why. discover new and enlightening ideas. challenge conventional views and make a difference. these, among so many more, are the messages of mr. bradbury’s masterpiece, a must read for fans of dystopian fiction.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              it is a truth universally acknowledged, that an author possessing immense talent and a good story to tell, must be in want of a reader like me to bestow upon it the laurels it merits. how else will anyone hear of it?ok, so p&p may not need my help. the word is likely already out. what that means is that i can scurry around the periphery of the story itself, make a few small points, and move on with near certitude that miss austen will have an audience regardless.it had been quite a while since i’d read anything written so long ago. of course, the language was very different, and for me that was part of the appeal. the musicality of it must owe to the baroque style of the time as well as to the skills of the writer. her words were precise and descriptors well-chosen. this passage about the piano-playing abilities of the lightly regarded middle sister is but one of many examples:\\n\"mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached.\"\\nthis example is also one of many instances where an air or manner was defined, or a countenance, bearing or nature. much was read into facial expressions, too. remember, this came from a time before “show, don’t tell.”as an older vintage depiction, there were also big differences in the social norms of the day -- the mores and the protocols. it’s a cliché to point out that austen’s books are about manners, but it’s true nonetheless. courtships, for instance, had rigid rules that are almost laughable to our modern ways of thinking. and the language was so stylized and indirect. subtitles would make for a good skit, like in annie hall where alvy is talking to annie early on about some abstract artsy thing while his real train of thought was, shall we say, less chaste. monetary details, class, and family reputation were important determinants in the matches of the day, too. books like this give us great historical insight into the social contracts and conventions.there’s no need for me to repeat in any detail what most people already know or could discover somewhere else better than this. elizabeth bennet is great. mr. darcy emerges. jane and bingley are charming, though nearly victims of a misunderstanding. mr. collins is an obsequious toad. mr. bennet is a bit too laissez-faire with a daughter or two who needed tighter reins. mrs. bennet is a woman “of weak understanding and illiberal mind.” (i should have been using miss austen’s wording throughout. it’s not like i could improve upon it.) lydia is heedless and wickham is evil. of these latter two it was said, “how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue.” the whole story is essentially how these characters play off of one another and sort out their relationships and their lives. yes, and it’s told really well. it’s more than just the costume drama enthusiasts with their immoderate taste for romanticism that sustain this as a classic.i’ll close this hodgepodge hash of a review by introducing a fun new parlor game involving a mishmash of p&p characters. pish posh you say? well hear me out. first of all, if you haven’t already done so, read the book and learn the traits and idiosyncrasies of the characters. they range widely over multiple dimensions. then take turns mapping these characters to the other players in the game. composites are encouraged. for instance, my lovely bride of 30 years is 0.872 elizabeth for her perception, quick wit, and probity; 0.127 jane for her beauty and good nature; and 0.001 mrs. bennet for having watched on more than one occasion that show where bridezillas rate other bridezillas’ weddings, critically and cattily. then look to see which participants turn red with embarrassment, or even redder with anger.    \n",

still cannot comprehend how i dnf this great work of literature. i love it so much, even more than sense and sensibility which i adore. i think i just found a new favourite classic.jane austen is a genius, that is the first thing you should know, the fact that this was published in 1813 seems so unreal, imagine those uptight 19th century people reading a leather bound copy of this.if you don't know the story of pride and prejudice prepare to be schooled, but beware of spoilers, i can't review this without mentioning some of my favourite spoilery parts, and if you have go ahead and read on.\\nit is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\nthat was the first paragraph, when you read that you'll be expecting a very cheesy love story but no, its nothing like that. there is politics, class division,family relationship, friendship and sisterly love.the bennets are a middle class family with 5 daughters, the eldest jane is 23 and lydia the last is 16. the middle girls are elizabeth,mary and catherine. at that time getting a rich husband is the highest thing a female can achieve and the bennets sisters are all of a marriageable age.when mr bingley a bachelor moved to the manor next door, the whole of the female population wants him as a husband but he picked jane, they fell in love had a falling in due to some interferances from his friend and family, but they sailed the storm and got married.moving on to my favourite couple, mr darcy and elizabeth bennet, he is extremely rich and she not so much. he is prideful and she prejudicial due to his pride and some grieve news she heard about him, she loathe him with passion. even when he first told her he loves her and proposed he did it in a prideful way, as if loving her was wrong, a quote of the scene.\\n\"in vain i have struggled. it will not do. my feelings will not be repressed. you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you.\"\\nyep, that was a proposal and yes she refused then due to the things she heard about him, but he later explained what actually happened and she could not help but feel bad for judging him so.when next they met, he was the most attentive, not his usual uptight civilness. he even told her that he would love to introduce her to his younger sister.\\n\"there is also one other person in the party,\" he continued after a pause, \"who more particularly wishes to be known to you. will you allow me, or do i ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton?\"\\nwhen she got to know him better, she realized that he is not as prideful as she thought but socially awkward. the more she got to know him the better she liked him and she also fell in love with him.months later after the first declaration of love and proposal he asked again, she has almost given up that he longer loves her, but he does.\\nafter a short pause, her companion added, \"you are too generous to trifle with me. if your feelings are still what they were last april, tell me so at once. my affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever.\"\\nshe was glad he asked cause now she no longer dislike him but love him. he even changed for the better because of her.\\n\"my object then,\" replied darcy, \"was to show you, by every civility in my power, that i was not so mean as to resent the past; and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to. how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell, but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you.\"\\nand below is more of my favourite quotes.\\nwhat made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here? why, especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not care about me?\"\"because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.\"\"but i was embarrassed.\"\"and so was i.\"\"you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.\"\"a man who had felt less, might.\"\"my real purpose was to see you, and to judge, if i could, whether i might ever hope to make you love me.\\n   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  it is a truth universally acknowledged, that an author possessing immense talent and a good story to tell, must be in want of a reader like me to bestow upon it the laurels it merits. how else will anyone hear of it?ok, so p&p may not need my help. the word is likely already out. what that means is that i can scurry around the periphery of the story itself, make a few small points, and move on with near certitude that miss austen will have an audience regardless.it had been quite a while since i’d read anything written so long ago. of course, the language was very different, and for me that was part of the appeal. the musicality of it must owe to the baroque style of the time as well as to the skills of the writer. her words were precise and descriptors well-chosen. this passage about the piano-playing abilities of the lightly regarded middle sister is but one of many examples:\\n\"mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached.\"\\nthis example is also one of many instances where an \"air\" or \"manner\" was defined, or a \"countenance\", \"bearing\" or \"nature\". much was read into facial expressions, too. remember, this came from a time before “show, don’t tell.”as an older vintage depiction, there were also big differences in the social norms of the day -- the mores and the protocols. it’s a cliché to point out that austen’s books are about manners, but it’s true nonetheless. courtships, for instance, had rigid rules that are almost laughable to our modern ways of thinking. and the language was so stylized and indirect. subtitles would make for a good skit, like in annie hall where alvy is talking to annie early on about some abstract artsy thing while his real train of thought was, shall we say, less chaste. monetary details, class, and family reputation were important determinants in the matches of the day, too. books like this give us great historical insight into the social contracts and conventions.there’s no need for me to repeat in any detail what most people already know or could discover somewhere else better than this. elizabeth bennet is great. mr. darcy emerges. jane and bingley are charming, though nearly victims of a misunderstanding. mr. collins is an obsequious toad. mr. bennet is a bit too laissez-faire with a daughter or two who needed tighter reins. mrs. bennet is a woman “of weak understanding and illiberal mind.” (i should have been using miss austen’s wording throughout. it’s not like i could improve upon it.) lydia is heedless and wickham is evil. of these latter two it was said, “how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue.” the whole story is essentially how these characters play off of one another and sort out their relationships and their lives. yes, and it’s told really well. it’s more than just the costume drama enthusiasts with their immoderate taste for romanticism that sustain this as a classic.i’ll close this hodgepodge hash of a review by introducing a fun new parlor game involving a mishmash of p&p characters. pish posh you say? well hear me out. first of all, if you haven’t already done so, read the book and learn the traits and idiosyncrasies of the characters. they range widely over multiple dimensions. then take turns mapping these characters to the other players in the game. composites are encouraged. for instance, my lovely bride of 30 years is 0.872 elizabeth for her perception, quick wit, and probity; 0.127 jane for her beauty and good nature; and 0.001 mrs. bennet for having watched on more than one occasion that show where bridezillas rate other bridezillas’ weddings, critically and cattily. then look to see which participants turn red with embarrassment, or even redder with anger. note: this is my review from a few years ago and may seem like a float. however, a gr technical glitch made the book reappear with a blank review box that i'm now filling with this old review. sorry if anyone rereads this expecting new content.   \n",

(okay so it's three and a bit but whatever) without rereading this what is wrong with me. 3/12/2015yes, on reread i'm bumping this up to 5 stars. something about that three year gap between readings - wtf past kirsti??? - made me appreciate the story so much more. lizzy is judgemental and sassy a lot of the time, but she's still an endearing character. darcy's a socially awkward dork. mr bennet's a little shit who, if he lived in the 21st century, would probably spend half his life staring at a wall and pretending he's staring directly into the camera like he's on the office. this book is basically a fuzzy blanket and a mug of hot chocolate on a rainy winter's afternoon: bliss. 5/11/2012there are no words to describe how much i love this book. i first read it when i was fifteen, and i've been reading it at least once a year since then (probably about six times when i was in year 11, because we studied it in english).it's not my favourite austen book (that honour goes to \"persuasion\"), but \"pride and prejudice\" is a close second. i love it from lizzy's witty comments to darcy's social awkwardness, from the bennet family embarrassment at the netherfield ball to lady catherine's visit to longbourne. if you haven't read it, you really should. it's a classic for a reason, and reading it time and time again is like visiting a friend you haven't seen in a while.

dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense.”\\n\\nwe are not worthy of jane austen's satire. i don't think i'm alone in that i usually go into a classic expecting not to have fun. do i expect lovely writing? yes. do i expect heavy themes that might not put me in a fun mood but have a lasting impact? you bet! (if i didn't that'd be an unnecessarily specific sentiment, right?) do i expect to laugh? uh... do i expect to evil cackle at the satire or at the extreme second-hand embarrassment? what...what kinds of classics would you be reading here, meredith?? well, dear reader (wrong book, mer), i would be reading pride and prejudice. (obviously.)i am a slow, slow reader. you'd think reading often i'd get quicker at it, but i've accepted my fate now. point is, i listened to the audiobook available on youtube as i read and not only did it help pace me quicker, it made it so much more fun. the british accents were amazing, and hearing the snarky satire read aloud felt like exactly how austen intended it because her dialogue is so much fun! just fun! i had a genuinely fun time with this! with this, a classic!! anyways, i don't feel qualified to be like hey, austen, you're a good writer. because of course she is? and who am i to compliment this queen? but, yea, the dialogue made the gossip and the scandal and utter cringe that is mr. collins so accessible and just a plain good time. did i mention this was fun?not only was the dialogue a highlight, but the times austen pops in to lowkey roast her own characters are fantastic.(“the strangeness of mr. collins’s making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted”....also...“they were ignorant, idle, and vain. while there was an officer in meryton, they would flirt with him; and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn, they would be going there forever”) i wouldn't call her satire super subtle, but i do think it's unexpected. here's a woman in the 18th or 19th century writing a romance novel, and it's nothing at all what the current times would suggest it to be. it's a powerful female lead (lizzy you icon you) who rejects multiple men (multiple times) and gives us quotes like this: “what are men to rocks and mountains?” i just..i respect that.so jane austen can write satire and i love that she uses that to further empower her female characters. and i love that she herself pops in to roast every character. the fact that no character is immune to austen's satire keeps the reader on their feet. and yes, it makes it fun. i am well aware of the criticism austen received and continues to receive about the fact that her books are gossipy and i am vaguely certain that charlotte bronte thought they lacked substance. but i am not opposed to reading things that are fun. and i would never say something fun is worth less than something deeply sad. i like this one. i can only hope i have half the grit and strength elizabeth and jane austen herself had someday. ---------------------elizabeth and darcy are the power couple i never knew i needed. lizzy telling off lady catherine? amazing. mr. bennet writing a passive aggressive note to mr. collins? iconic! i'm excited to check out more by jane austen!review to come!   \n",

the premise of this book, and rather than do a normal review, i thought maybe i'd question how on earth kafka came up with this one? it was such a great way to tell the story and teach a lesson... a man wakes up as a giant beetle? (i secretly suspect he came across a huge cockroach in his apartment while in nyc one day). and how do you deal with such a change? your family is afraid. they are embarrassed. you can talk. what's really going on here? what is kafka trying to say about life? we're all insensitive? liars? fakes? humorists? nutty? so many things to read into here... it's a run book, too. when you're a bug life's quite different. have you ever managed something like that before? no. so how did kafka come up with all the little things to make it real? i'm glad he did as this book helps you enjoy reading when you may be forced to read some classics at a younger age that don't appeal to you. as an more mature reader, you find all the symbols and beauty in the messages with this one. i believe i read it twice, possibly some excerpts for a third instance. each time, it gets better. i would love to see a really good film or tv adaption... purely to witness the metaphorical views a director would incorporate on the big screen or the stage. the words are amazing, but it's what you experience by reading it that makes it such a wonderful book.\\n\\nabout me\\n\\nfor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: i read a lot. i write a lot. and now i blog a lot. first the book review goes on goodreads, and then i send it on over to my wordpress blog at https://thisismytruthnow.com, where you'll also find tv & film reviews, the revealing and introspective 365 daily challenge and lots of blogging about places i've visited all over the world. and you can find all my social media profiles to get the details on the who/what/when/where and my pictures. leave a comment and let me know what you think. vote in the poll and ratings. thanks for stopping by.    \n",

beetle during the night. no reason is given for gregor's metamorphosis, and he acts calm about the situation. gregor is such a good dependable traveling saleman that he only seems upset that he is going to be late for work. his supervisor from work is unsympathetic, and the business is portrayed as uncaring toward its employees. his family seems to worry more about the loss of income than for gregor's welfare. as the story progresses, gregor's emotions stay very human while his behavior becomes more and more like an insect. gregor is so emotionally conflicted that he loses his appetite for food.gregor's family is undergoing a metamorphosis as much as he is. although his sister tries to take care of him in the beginning, his family reaches the point where he is too much of a burden and they no longer value him. they are stressed, embarrassed, and financially struggling. kafka seems to be pointing out how family dynamics change, and how society isolates people with physical and mental problems. the family members change from being very dependent on gregor to becoming more self-sufficient. their metamorphosis is complete at the end as they look to the future.i really enjoyed this novella because it contained so much about human emotions as well as business, society, and family dynamics which often can be difficult and unhappy. life is sometimes unfair as it throws terrible challenges at good people. this would be interesting to read in a classroom setting to hear other people's ideas about the book. the cute \"google doodle\" on july 3, 2013 showed a big upright beetle or cockroach coming through the door with a traveling salesman's suitcase in honor of kafka's 130th birthday. that gave me the extra push to finally get around to reading this classic.

       "13296   this is another \"classic\" book that i'm glad i didn't try reading in high school. in this case it's my opinion that brave new world should be included as a classic, unlike some other classics i've read. this book sent me through a wide range of emotions, ultimately with the end leaving me thinking \"whoa, what just happened?\" i was a little embarrassed to have to search the internet for \"what happened at the end of brave new world\" after i finished reading the book, but thankfully it looks like many other people didn't really get it either. i guess i understood what happened, but i didn't really understand the meaning of it. i've searched for quite a while for anything that huxley may have said about the book but there's not much out there on the subject. the main thing i found is that huxley originally started writing the book as a parody to poke fun at some of his contemporaries such as h.g. wells. there are some clear themes throughout the book, but i guess it's up to the reader to decide what he thinks the whole point of it is.brave new world is a quite disturbing view of the future where there is no such thing as families, mothers (\"mother\" is a taboo word in their society), fathers, sadness, and meaning in life. instead of being born, children are created in factories and conditioned for their future lives as alphas, betas, deltas, gammas, and epsilons. alphas and betas are the ruling class while the other three classes are the worker bees, servants, etc. but it's ok that they are sorted into classes because, due to their childhood conditioning, they are all happy with the group they belong to and wouldn't rather do anything else besides the job they were meant to have. promiscuous sex is encouraged, in fact it is disgusting and extremely inappropriate for people to pair off. everyone is provided rations of soma, a drug that fogs the mind and creates feelings of happiness and enjoyment. citizens use soma whenever they start to have any sort of negative emotion or feeling. at work the people are conditioned to behave as adults, but outside of work they are to act as children. there are innumerable entertainment options provided for the people to enjoy such as electromagnetic golf and \"feelies\" (basically movies with sensations, smells, etc.). there are no diseases, people are kept looking young for their entire lives, and then when it's time to die they live at death centers and no one is sad. there isn't really anyone to feel sad for them anyway since no one has families and they don't really have close friends either.long story shorter a couple of the main characters named bernard and lenina visit a \"savage reservation\" which is essentially a zoo where native americans are allowed to live the old way and the people in the brave new world can come visit and study them. bernard and lenina bring back a boy named john whose mother originally came from the brave new world. we read about john's perspective of the brave new world compared to his \"savage\" upbringing. john eventually has a pretty amazing conversation with the world's head \"controller\" which i'll provide some quotes from below. i won't spoil the ending here but it was intense and quite abrupt. of course since this is a dystopian book there were some elements of the future world that huxley describes that are very unbelievable but there were also some things he described that seem extremely prescient since he wrote this in 1931.some other highlights:- bernard sometimes doubts the merits of the society, seems like he could end up being the hero- helmholtz finds it difficult to be a writer when there's not much to write about- the people constantly repeating the conditioning phrases they heard hundreds of thousands of times as children in the conditioning centershere are some interesting quotes from the book:\"'but, bernard, you're saying the most awful things.' 'don't you wish you were free, lenina?' 'i don't know what you mean. i am free. free to have the most wonderful time. everybody's happy nowadays.' he laughed, 'yes, everybody's happy nowadays. we begin giving children that at five. but wouldn't you like to be free to be happy in some other way, lenina? in your own way, for example; not in everybody else's way.'\"\"'that'll teach him,' he said to himself. but he was mistaken. for bernard left the room with a swagger, exulting, as he banged the door behind him, in the thought that he stood alone, embattled against the order of things; elated by the intoxicating consciousness of his individual significance and importance.\"\"\"ladies and gentlemen,\" the director repeated once more, \"excuse me for thus interrupting your labours. a painful duty constrains me. the security and stability of society are in danger. yes, in danger, ladies and gentlemen. this man,\" he pointed accusingly at bernard, \"this man who stands before you here, this alpha-plus to whom so much has been given, and from whom, in consequence, so much must be expected, this colleague of yours–or should i anticipate and say this ex-colleague?–has grossly betrayed the trust imposed in him. by his heretical views on sport and soma, by the scandalous unorthodoxy of his sex-life, by his refusal to obey the teachings of our ford and behave out of office hours, 'even as a little infant,'\" (here the director made the sign of the t), \"he has proved himself an enemy of society, a subverter, ladies and gentlemen, of all order and stability, a conspirator against civilization itself. for this reason i propose to dismiss him, to dismiss him with ignominy from the post he has held in this centre; i propose forthwith to apply for his transference to a subcentre of the lowest order and, that his punishment may serve the best interest of society, as far as possible removed from any important centre of population.\" \"'do they read shakespeare?' asked the savage as they walked, on their way to the bio-chemical laboratories, past the school library.'certainly not,' said the head mistress, blushing. 'our library,' said dr. gaffney, 'contains only books of reference. if our young people need distraction, they can get it at the feelies. we don't encourage them to indulge in any solitary amusements.'\"\"a new theory of biology\" was the title of the paper which mustapha mond had just finished reading. he sat for some time, meditatively frowning, then picked up his pen and wrote across the title-page: \"the author's mathematical treatment of the conception of purpose is novel and highly ingenious, but heretical and, so far as the present social order is concerned, dangerous and potentially subversive. not to be published.\" he underlined the words. \"the author will be kept under supervision. his transference to the marine biological station of st. helena may become necessary.\" a pity, he thought, as he signed his name. it was a masterly piece of work. but once you began admitting explanations in terms of purpose–well, you didn't know what the result might be. it was the sort of idea that might easily decondition the more unsettled minds among the higher castes–make them lose their faith in happiness as the sovereign good and take to believing, instead, that the goal was somewhere beyond, somewhere outside the present human sphere, that the purpose of life was not the maintenance of well-being, but some intensification and refining of consciousness, some enlargement of knowledge. which was, the controller reflected, quite possibly true. but not, in the present circumstance, admissible. he picked up his pen again, and under the words \"not to be published\" drew a second line, thicker and blacker than the first; then sighed, \"what fun it would be,\" he thought, \"if one didn't have to think about happiness!\" \"a v.p.s. treatment indeed! she would have laughed, if she hadn't been on the point of crying. as though she hadn't got enough v. p. of her own! she sighed profoundly as she refilled her syringe. 'john,' she murmured to herself, 'john …' then 'my ford,' she wondered, 'have i given this one its sleeping sickness injection, or haven't i?' she simply couldn't remember. in the end, she decided not to run the risk of letting it have a second dose, and moved down the line to the next bottle. twenty-two years, eight months, and four days from that moment, a promising young alpha-minus administrator at mwanza-mwanza was to die of trypanosomiasis–the first case for over half a century. sighing, lenina went on with her work.\"mustapha mond smiled. \"well, you can call it an experiment in rebottling if you like. it began in a.f. 473. the controllers had the island of cyprus cleared of all its existing inhabitants and re-colonized with a specially prepared batch of twenty-two thousand alphas. all agricultural and industrial equipment was handed over to them and they were left to manage their own affairs. the result exactly fulfilled all the theoretical predictions. the land wasn't properly worked; there were strikes in all the factories; the laws were set at naught, orders disobeyed; all the people detailed for a spell of low-grade work were perpetually intriguing for high-grade jobs, and all the people with high-grade jobs were counter-intriguing at all costs to stay where they were. within six years they were having a first-class civil war. when nineteen out of the twenty-two thousand had been killed, the survivors unanimously petitioned the world controllers to resume the government of the island. which they did. and that was the end of the only society of alphas that the world has ever seen.\"\"awful? they don't find it so. on the contrary, they like it. it's light, it's childishly simple. no strain on the mind or the muscles. seven and a half hours of mild, unexhausting labour, and then the soma ration and games and unrestricted copulation and the feelies. what more can they ask for? true,\" he added, \"they might ask for shorter hours. and of course we could give them shorter hours. technically, it would be perfectly simple to r...   \n",

first time at an age where i can articulate my emotions, because if i had read it in high school, i'm pretty sure the entire world would have be reduced to pink mist at the frustrated and disgruntled hands of my ak-47.it slices me in half that this drivel is so lauded when there are kindergarten kids writing perfectly good sentences about whales and bananas which never make it out of the classroom, much less onto a 100-books-to-read-before-you-die list. there were a couple of astute observations, and there are several passages that are quite amusing, but the problem is that by the time you get to them, you are so atrophied with boredom that your body no longer remembers how to laugh and can only emit a slow, pained whine instead. or maybe that was just holden, moaning again?there is absolutely nothing this character does not complain about. i'm pretty sure that if a clown tried to give him a balloon filled with 40 million dollars, holden would call him a phoney and tell him to fuck off. are we supposed to be surprised that he's actually a virgin? of course he is. imagine him having sex with someone - \"my orgasm was pretty crummy. how was yours goddammit. wait...you didn't have one? are you a phoney? boy, that kills me, if you want to know the truth. i mean. boy.\"no wonder jd salinger became a recluse after this became so successful. i'd be embarrassed too.   \n",

took me until i was over 50 to pick up. i knew that it would be classic. i knew that it would be a fun read. i was, however, surprised to find the subversive social commentary running just below the surface of the story. i was also embarrassingly unaware of how tightly the movie “pirates of the caribbean” mirrored “treasure island.” the plot was not a match, but many of the characters have a one to one mapping and both share the underlying messages that legality and morality are not the same thing and that there is no such thing as pure good guys and pure bad guys.   \n",

about, and i don't think i ever watched a movie adaptation of it. i'm not mad, though, because that might be why i enjoyed this book so much. what great fun! treasure island is a classic ya novel intended for young boys written by stevenson, who i am coming to believe might have been a genius. i read the strange case of dr. jeckyll and mr. hyde earlier this year and loved it, so i picked this one up with high expectations. the two books are so different in so many ways that i am having a hard time believing they were written by the same author. jeckyll and hyde was thick with psychology and character building, but treasure island doesn't care one lick about that. treasure island is simply an adventure story; there are tons of colorful characters here but we never really learn why the characters are how they are, and we really don't care. with 13 year old jim as the narrator, the reader gets a peek into the foolish bravado of a young man on a treasure hunt. there are dangerous situations, mutinous pirates everywhere, and a 13 year old who jumps in the thick of it. he tells us many times during his narrative that he is the hero of this story and ends every chapter with a mini-cliffhanger to keep us all wanting more. this book was the origin of everything pop culture knows about pirates: the pirate language, the parrot on the shoulder of the peg-legged long john silver, the dead man's chest, x marks the spot on a treasure map, and so many other things. it is also the origin of my new obsession with pirates, even if i am a long way behind everyone else.

early since it is typically a 2-hour train journey to get to the city library. on the way, i watched all the frolic panic among the people hurrying to their workplace. eating their breakfast on the train, making up their hairs, and a bunch of other people trying to find space in the crowded footboard. i wondered why people go further anyway. i felt guilty not being among them continuing the cycle of whatever this is and call it a meaningful existence. it worried me a bit myself standing in between the conventional spectator and curious inquisitor of values and social constructs especially why something has more values than others. basically, it's all up to us deciding which has more value. power resides where people believe it resides for we are the beings under the influence of it since the known past. this existential philosophy scared me a bit that if existence precedes the essence, as said by sartre, the literal meaning of life is anything that we choose to be. it wouldn't favor much except for the personal whim and fancies of subjective experience. my thoughts couldn't help anymore but somehow i convinced myself that i'd become normal once after reaching the library and completing this book of camus. this habitual convincing and despair has been repeating in a while for the past couple years. maybe i'm in the cycle of absurdities on this phase of my life but some part of me doesn't want to believe it as it didn't mean anything while the other parts find it a great secret and a great comfort for finding reasons to exist even if it is for a moment.i found a translation of penguin hardcover edition, headed straight to the couch to get started. and it started \"mother died today. or yesterday maybe, i don't know\", it's a nice way to start a novel. mersault was more like a modern-day buddhist having his own values, self-awareness of being in the present and unconventional perceptions that makes him look aloof by the readers from the very starting. he didn't cry for the death of his mother because he thought it's quite natural for someone to die at some point of life.\"when it comes down to life, i wasn't aware of the fact that it doesn't matter much whether you die at 30 or 75\"it took me a while understanding that there are only facts or events without any explanation so that the readers are unconsciously forced back to reflect on their own life to look for interpretations for the actions of mersault the protagonist. but it wasn't the case for me for i've read the myth of sisyphus which share the pretty much same questioning and inquiring of values but with tedious explanations and thought process of multifarious complexity, and his other short essay on the capital punishment for the second part of the novel where mersault happen to kill an arab and set to face the trial. the narration might give a culmination of satirical, indifferent take on certain values based on family, law(not justice) and other presumed existential certainties that society took for absolute. \"he seemed so certain of everything, didn't he? and yet none of his certainties was worth one hair of woman's head.\"as author elucidated in the afterword, mersault was condemned because he didn't play the game under the rules of the society for he was the outsider. i never understood since the day i read somewhere camus told that he wasn't an existentialist philosopher and very different from the contemporaries like jean-paul satre. this book is exactly an anti-existentialist work and also one of the classic existentialist works of the twentieth century. the point is that absurdity is divine. the only way to be in agreement with life is to disagree with ourselves.it ends up something like this, “and i, too, felt ready to start life all over again. it was as if that great rush of anger had washed me clean, emptied me of hope, and, gazing up at the dark sky spangled with its signs and stars, for the first time, the first, i laid my heart open to the benign indifference of the universe. to feel it so like myself, indeed, so brotherly, made me realize that i’d been happy, and that i was happy still.”, at the point where he was ready to accept the death rather \"getting free\" by submitting to the providence. i couldn't figure out the working but i somehow started sobbing inside the library without realizing my presence. some people made sure i was okay. i started leaving the library then, to avoid further embarrassment, that the intensity of the suffering was no less diminished, i looked down the busy road with honking bikes and smoking cars, indistinct chattering and the heat waves blew over tried vainly to rip apart the silence of my cold damn numbed mind. maybe i should get used to this indifference. it didn't make much sense but i found comfort and suffering walking through the shoes of mersault.\"a life in which each man's destiny is merely to age and die; the feeling that, at time, one is a stranger not merely for others but to oneself\"basically what camus did his entire life was encourage people to lose themselves in finding harmony and confusion in nothingness and in the concept of absurdism, then finding themselves revolting against it, and then eventually finding the others exercising some control over the values and morals. at least, we could say he had a meaningful existence but it’s quite natural to say it doesn’t mean anything.   \n",

where they discover a wardrobe that takes them to a fantasy world where animals talk and it is always winter. one of the siblings betrays the others; a terrible sacrifice is made, and a prophecy fulfilled. i re-read this children's classic a day after seeing the new movie, as i was curious to see how closely the movie followed the book. i was pleased to see the little details that carried over (like mr. tumnus' red muffler) as well as the larger elements. what differences there were imho were due to the constraints of the movie format and expectations of the modern-day audience. i'm still quite enchanted by this story... despite the slight embarrassment as a child of thinking the grand tents in which aslan's army was encamped were called \"pav-uh-lons\". the christian allegory is strong, but not a blunt object beating one about the head & shoulders. iirc, it gets more obvious throughout the series... however, i don't remember a whole lot about the other books, except the voyage of the dawn treader. recommended to any fantasy fan looking for a classic of the genre. notes & quotes\" 'course he [aslan] isn't safe. but he's good.\"\"and whether it was more like playing with a thunderstorm or playing with a kitten, lucy could never make up her mind.\" in movie - the queen's wolf enforcer = megrim... in book = fenris ulf... why?

classics, here’s an excellent science fiction novel that looks at this important ethical question. the story is about charlie gordon, a thirty-two-year-old man with a low iq. committed to a state home as a teenager, now he is out. he’s living in a rooming house and working at a bakery in new york, all through the help of a family friend. he is happy, has friends at work and friends at his school, where he has worked hard to learn how to read and write.because of charlie’s impressive motivation, professor nemur and dr. strauss from beekman university determine he is an excellent candidate for an experimental procedure to increase intelligence, one that has only been performed on mice. algernon is their superstar mouse that has learned how to navigate through complicated mazes. now nemur and strauss want to take it to the next level.charlie is willing. “after the operashun im gonna try to be smart. im gonna try awful hard,” he writes.the surgery is a seeming success and charlie’s intelligence increases, at first slowly, but later at a fantastic rate. soon he is reading voraciously and learning ancient languages, complex theories, sciences, history, economics and classic literature and eventually surpassing nemur and strauss. but charlie’s emotional intelligence is woefully behind and he doesn’t know what to do with the many new strong and complex feelings he experiences.through memory recall, charlie begins to understand that the people in his life had been cruel to him, with their hurtful jokes and abuse, and that he had played a part in their jokes. “that hurts most of all,” he writes.in addition, memories of his mother’s shame and embarrassment and her ultimate rejection make charlie’s new knowledge painful. even nemur and strauss treat him as an experiment and not as a human, forgetting that he was already a person with feelings before the surgery.at his intellectual peak, charlie detects a flaw in the theory and foresees his decline. how will it end as algernon runs through his maze and charlie navigates his own complicated path? with limited time, charlie will try to figure it out. he writes, “i see now that the path i choose through that maze makes me what i am.”flowers for algernon began as a short story in 1959. in 1960, it won the hugo award for best short story. the novel was published in 1966 and was the joint winner of the nebula award for best novel. no surprise that both forms won awards. despite being an older story, flowers for algernon raises important points about human feelings and the ethics of scientific experimentation.   \n",
       "22602   i first came across flowers for algernon as a short story in a science fiction anthology many years ago. it seemed an enjoyably poignant and perceptive slight tale. by 1966 the author daniel keyes had developed his story into this full length novel, the joint winner of the year's nebula award for the best science fiction novel. it was the high point of daniel keyes’s career. as well as nonfiction he has written several other science fiction books which explore the workings of the mind. but the classic flowers for algernon has sold more than five million copies, and has never been out of print since its original publication. daniel keyes's science fiction stories were intermittently published during the 1950s, before he became a fiction editor at marvel science fiction. he also worked as a high school teacher for developmentally disabled adults. these two experiences resulted in the masterpiece, flowers for algernon. daniel keyes said that the idea for the story struck him while he waited for an elevated train to take him from brooklyn to new york university in 1945. in his 1999 memoir, he wrote,\"i thought: my education is driving a wedge between me and the people i love. and then i wondered: 'what would happen if it were possible to increase a person's intelligence?'\"the best speculative stories start from a simple idea: \"what if?\" this is such a story. it has no need for alien worlds, galactic swashbucklers, bug-eyed monsters or complicated spaceship technology. this is not the world of hard sci fi, focusing on science and the inhuman aspects of other worlds. like all classic science fiction, it seems to transcend the limitations of the genre. it explores universal human themes such as the nature of intelligence, the nature of emotion, and how the two interact with each other. even the intelligence-enhancing surgery is not detailed, except for brief mentions of the workings of the brain, and the rare genetic condition phenylketonuria, to add authenticity to the enhanced intellectual capabilities of the narrator. the story is told from the point of view of a thirty-two-year-old man, who has been assessed as having an iq of 68. the narrator, charlie gordon, works at donner’s bakery in new york city as a janitor and delivery boy. he writes that he,\"reely wantd to lern i wantid it more even then pepul who are smarter even then me … all my life i wantid to be smart and not dumb\".his teacher alice kinnian, who works at the \"beekman college centre for retarded adults\", recognises his strong motivation and desire to learn. she has put him forward as a potential candidate to undergo experimental surgery designed to boost his intelligence.a team of university researchers have already performed the experiment successfully on the lab mouse algernon. charlie has a number of tests, including a comparison with algernon to indicate how quickly he can solve a maze. this part of the book sets the tone for the gentle humour which is to follow. charlie reports the tests with perfect childlike clarity and literal incomprehension. he has no imagination; no ability to invent. the directors of the experiment, dr. strauss and professor nemur, agree that charlie is a good choice, and ask charlie to keep a journal, “dr strauss says i shoud rite down what i think and remembir and evrey thing that happins to me from now on.”the entire narrative of flowers for algernon is composed of this series of “progress reports” which charlie writes in his diary. charlie is excited and optimistic, despite the scientists' caution,\"you know charlie we are not shure how this experamint will werk on pepul because we only tried it up to now on animils.\" at this point the reader realises that not only we will be able to anticipate charlie's progress by watching algernon's burgeoning intelligence, but we will be able to deduce it by the content and linguistic competence of charlie's journal. it is a brilliantly inspired device on the part of daniel keyes. charlie's teacher alice continues to help him improve his spelling and grammar, and he determinedly reads adult books, filling his brain with knowledge from a wide range of academic fields. his progress is slow at first, but his comprehension accelerates as he devours his reading, delighting in his new-found knowledge and understanding,\"this is beauty, love, and truth all rolled into one. this is joy.\"the story follows both the events in the laboratory, and events in charlie's personal life. it becomes clear that the owner of the bakery is being kind to charlie in keeping him in work, and that it has really been an act of charity. his co-workers however frequently make fun of and mock him. charlie, on the other hand, has always viewed them as his true friends. the realisation that what he thought of as shared jokes are taunts, and that he is a laughing stock, is very hurtful to him. we feel his pain through his faithful record, \"i never knew before that joe and frank and the others liked to have me around just to make fun of me. now i know what they mean when they say 'to pull a charlie gordon'. i'm ashamed.\"as he begins to realise the truth of the psychiatrist dr. strauss's observation,\"the more intelligent you get the more problems you'll have charlie.\"charlie continues to work hard at the bakery, (view spoiler)[even inventing a process to improve productivity. but the surgery on him is a secret. and because his emotional development cannot keep pace with his astonishing mental feats, he does not realise that he is now alienated from the other workers, frank and joe, and gimpy, the head baker, who has a club foot. they cannot understand the changes and are disturbed by the sudden change in him. they begin to fear him. charlie on the other hand is learning all the time and pleased at his new challenges in interacting with other people. one event produces a moral dilemma, which he attempts to solve, but which eventually leads to him losing his job. (hide spoiler)] \"before, they had laughed at me, despising me for my ignorance and dullness; now, they hated me for my knowledge and understanding.\"perplexed, charlie approaches the scientists to help him, and the advice from each reflects their differing world views. alice recognises that he needs to develop and experience moral quandries for himself, and tells him to trust his heart. this is an everyday moral dilemma, but one which has no easy or right answer.\"what's right? ironic that all my intelligence doesn't help me solve a problem like this.\"there are many layers to charlie gordon. as he develops, his personality changes. thrilled at first to learn, he begins to be alternately angry and embarrassed when he remembers what he sees as his earlier foolish self. he also begins to remember his early childhood, and we learn all about his parents, rose and matt gordon.(view spoiler)[ his father had been a barber's shop supply salesman, who hated both his job and his life. his mother's overriding concern was to \"be smart\" and keep up appearances. charlie remembers that he had a sister, who was considered to be a replacement for him, and named norma because it sounded like “normal.” these sections where he gradually recovers lost memories of his childhood are very moving. as charlie and the reader learns more, we begin to realise that charlie's childhood was not the happy dream that he had envisaged. (hide spoiler)] all the flashbacks are interspersed with the narrative, so that the stories of charlie’s present and past intertwine and reflect upon each other, adding to both charlie's and the reader's understanding of the current situation.as his brain becomes more incisive, charlie learns sarcasm, suspicion, and resentment. his faith in the people around him begins to crumble, \"now i understand that one of the reasons for going to college and getting an education is to learn that the things you've believed in all your life aren't true, and that nothing is what it appears to be.\"\"i'm confused. i don't know what i know any more.\"(view spoiler)[the one person he trusts is alice, but whenever charlie contemplates becoming intimate, he feels as if the old charlie is watching him. distracted, he panics and his mind dissociates. charlie is confused about the origin of this, but the reader understands that it is a deep-seated memory of rose punishing and beating him for any slight sexual impulses, resulting in the shame he still feels. (hide spoiler)] charlie's feeling of his \"other self\" becomes stronger as the novel proceeds, continually resurfacing at crucial points, in the form of the old charlie, perceived as a separate entity existing outside of himself. in this and other ways, the past persists in the present. for instance, he remembers long ago watching through a window in his apartment, as other children played. later, with his enhanced intelligence, he feels as if the old charlie is watching him through a window. the window seems to represent an emotional distance: a barrier to normal society, which the mentally disabled charlie cannot cross. later, he is just as distanced from his former self as the children he used to watch playing had been. once he sees the other charlie face-to-face in a mirror, a glimpse of his other self: a very frightening experience.delighted with charlie's progress, dr. strauss and professor nemur take both charlie and algernon to a scientific convention in chicago. but charlie has reservations, \"how different they seem now. and how foolish i was ever to have thought that professors were intellectual giants. they're people - and afraid the rest of the world will find out.\"\"i'm not an inanimate object ... i'm a person ... i was a person before the operation. in case you forgot.\" dr. strauss has always been concerned with his psychological health, but charlie feels that nemur treats him like just another lab animal. it is transparently clear that charlie’s scientific knowledge has advanced beyond professor nemur’s.(view spoiler)[in d...   \n",
       "22703                                                                                                                                                                                              before seagulls with roiders' arms, dolly, and jeff goldblum arguing about dinosaurs, there was flowers for algernon to ask the question: has science gone too far? after algernon the mouse not only reached the cheese in variously arranged mazes faster than the other mice, but hasn’t for some time seemed about to spontaneously combust or collapse into a black hole, the go-ahead is given for charlie gordon, his i.q. at 60, to undergo surgery to maximize his intelligence. from page one, daniel keyes drops us into charlie’s head, through which we see the world via charlie’s progress reports recording his day-to-day events and thoughts. it would be nice if, from the outset, charlie had lived with a loving family. it would be nice if he brought home sweet-smelling bread and cakes he made with best friends who were also his co-workers. it would be nice if, at school, he met with someone pretty he could fall in love with. it would be nice if they all loved him just the way he was, of an intelligence society has agreed to be unworthy of further than a moment’s thought, and they all joined hands together and skipped merrily into the orange-golden sunset towards a happily-ever-after ending. it would be nice. but it would be wishful thinking, realized in some other book written in some other reality that probably no one would read because its niceness clashed with their expectations for plausibility, which keyes is only too happy to accommodate. 47 years later, 54 if you count the short story that preceded it, flowers for algernon’s impact doesn’t seem to have dissipated any. “hey, since the world’s not depressing enough, if i wanted a book that’d make me ugly-cry to beat claire danes, what would you recommend?” after scrolling past the usual green, zusak, mccarthy, orwell, and dostoyevsky shout-outs, marking a few names to check back on later, keyes’s mention would invariably rise up to the top to float alongside the rest, his book a tiny, unassuming thing. but the reason i picked flowers for algernon was more because it seemed a natural next-read after the curious incident of the dog in the night-time. marcelo in the real world and 600 hours of edward were noticeable blips on my radar, too, yet starting from the beginning felt like the thing to do. those two books are going to have to wait now¹ because keyes took my feelings and did a real number on them. my icy thoughts were feeble before the sheer earnestness and circumstances of charlie gordon: “i dont care so much about bee-ing famus. i just want to be smart like other pepul so i can have lots of frends who like me.” keyes pulls no punches, as that’s not even twenty pages into the book. it’s hard not to like charlie, that is, at least as he was in the beginning. by the halfway mark, the book almost soured me on his character when his increased intelligence made him as insufferable as everyone else in the book found him. to better illustrate the progression of my goodwill towards charlie, here’s a very rough graph i put together in paint (i’m no hans rosling, so have a heart): at the height of charlie’s intelligence, he was at his most unlikable. even when keeping his history in mind, i thought him, as one character² put it, “an arrogant, self-centered, antisocial bastard.” it couldn’t be helped. he didn’t make it easy, what with his condescension (“i've got to guard against the natural tendency to look down on them now that i have surpassed them…” [notwithstanding the fact that he’s a genius]), his jokes (“just goes to show that you can't have everything you want in one woman. one more argument for polygamy…”), his priorities (“i went home and made love to fay, but kept thinking of alice…” [stop stringing her along, dude]), and his stubbornness (“if you don't open the door, i'm going to break it down…” [forget her!]). near and in the ending, i came to like him again only because he regressed, which i realize is majorly screwed-up. when the book finished, i got to thinking, and then it hit me, the way keyes so deftly toyed with my emotions. charlie at his cleverest was unrelatable, but i wasn’t supposed to relate to him. i was acting exactly like charlie’s co-workers at the bakery when he showed them up, his doctors when he embarrassed them, and alice and fay when he confused them. like them, i didn’t understand charlie’s intelligence, so i was quick to feel exasperation, resentment, and even some hostility. all that he has experienced is justification enough for how he feels, and keyes’s writing is very neatly and subtly done to show that. that said, i do still wish humility were a giant tuna with which to knock some sense into him.considering its subject matter, and despite its length, flowers for algernon is no light read. it would make you think, and then leave you faintly dissatisfied with your conclusions. is it right for charlie’s doctors to fiddle around with that which is beyond their comprehension? an answer in the negative comes easily enough to us, but what if they knew what they were doing? it gets murky here. people are going to have opinions and heated words. take it from me: born with profound deafness and went on the operating table nine years later for a cochlear implant. at that age, i saw it all as fun and games, oblivious to the gravity of the situation. the early scenes of flowers for algernon, especially those leading up to charlie’s surgery and the recovery afterwards, felt oddly familiar. charlie took to anesthesia (“so i breethed deep and then i gess i was very tired becase i went to sleep…”) much better than i did (i was made to count backwards and then had to be held down three numbers later). there’s a scene where charlie, at a conference which he headlines, is being paraded out by his doctors in front of a curious audience of scientists. i shared charlie’s sense of unreality when he heard himself being referred to as if he were not even in the same room. before i was cleared to receive my implant, i had to be thoroughly assessed and evaluated. my memory here is spotty, so i had no idea the process was so exhaustive until, some years back, i uncovered papers of the doctor’s notes, test results, and evaluation papers packed away in forgotten boxes. from my speaking and language skills (with english being my second language, i knew almost none of it beyond the very basic words gleaned from the tom and jerry cartoons) to hearing ability, everything relevant was examined. “james presents with a bilateral severe to profound hearing loss… james gave 17 ‘preferred’ responses and 5 ‘acceptable’ responses…” it’s not a little bizarre to read about yourself observed so clinically. but rather than “delightful,” “social,” and “a pleasure to work with” (not to toot my own horn), charlie gets called “a feeble-minded shell [and] a burden on the society,” so our situations are unfortunately not quite so comparable. but going back to my original point, my handicap and charlie’s may be very different, yet there’s arguably no less controversy surrounding cochlear implants, which the deaf culture sees as a threat to their way of life³. “who's to say that my light is better than your darkness?” it seems so simple to make a snap judgment until you put yourself in their shoes.if simba’s shaking mufasa’s corpse, macaulay culkin’s happy encounter with a bee colony in my girl, every harry potter death, what lotso did to the toys at the garbage dump, and all of schindler’s list didn’t send my waterworks into overdrive, nothing else will. sadness is not totally lost on me, however, and flowers for algernon packs a mean punch or two that, even when expected, still caught me unawares. yet there are occasionally light-hearted moments to keep you from descending into complete despair: a scene where algernon gets a girlfriend charlie has to decide first to be “of sound health and good moral character” before green-lighting the match is a riot. there’s also a fair bit of philosophizing that narrowly avoids sounding annoying and the occasional surprise of great writing combined with chilling insight, particularly when the book gets into warren home school, a mental institution. keyes points out much in the world that is frustrating: questionable parenting, bullying, and the arrogance and wastefulness of the scientific community (“papers like these made me angry. money, time, and energy squandered on the detailed analysis of the trivial...” and “another case of men devoting their lives to studying more and more about less and less…”). but keyes keeps returning in the book to society’s treatment (or lack thereof), most of it unthinking, jealous, and cruel, of the mentally challenged. it’s flattering to think of ourselves now as wiser and more magnanimous towards anyone and everyone. that’s a dangerous position to take. despite our best efforts, prejudices linger, and the uphill battle to stomp them out completely doesn’t look to be leveling out any time soon. “she said for a person who god gave so little to you did more than a lot of people with brains they never even used.” our denials, no matter how loud, don’t change how there’s that hubris of man, big or small, obvious or dormant, residing in all of us. there’s something wrong with the picture if it’s those of sound mind who need more humanizing than those without, and so long as that remains true, flowers for algernon will be a classic. even if and when the opposite becomes reality, the book will still be invaluable, if not all the more so, for being so honest a cautionary tale.¹after the curious incident and now flowers for algernon, i am in dire need of puppies, rainbows, and laughter.²that one character may be just as much of a bastard, but he’s not that far off the mark.³the sound and fury documentary elaborates more on this issue.   \n",

becomes unstuck in time after he is abducted by aliens from the planet tralfamadore. in a plot-scrambling display of virtuosity, we follow pilgrim simultaneously through all phases of his life, concentrating on his (and vonnegut's) shattering experience as an american prisoner of war who witnesses the firebombing of dresden.don't let the ease of reading fool you - vonnegut's isn't a conventional, or simple, novel. he writes, \"there are almost no characters in this story, and almost no dramatic confrontations, because most of the people in it are so sick, and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces. one of the main effects of war, after all, is that people are discouraged from being characters.\"slaughterhouse-five is not only vonnegut's most powerful book, it is also as important as any written since 1945. like catch- 22, it fashions the author's experiences in the second world war into an eloquent and deeply funny plea against butchery in the service of authority. slaughterhouse-five boasts the same imagination, humanity, and gleeful appreciation of the absurd found in vonnegut's other works, but the book's basis in rock-hard, tragic fact gives it a unique poignancy - and humor.my review: the doubleday uk meme, a book a day for july 2014, is the goad i'm using to get through my snit-based unwritten reviews. today's prompt is to select your very favorite american novel in honor of the fourth of july. well! that would take a few zillion hours of internal debate, creation of endless lists, rebellious actions like breaking things down into genre lists, muttering over who counts as american (teju cole is, but henry james isn't: discuss), etc. etc.decision made for me, in this case, by the fact that i'm trying to strong-arm myself into making a dent in the embarrassingly long list of things i've read, re-read, or abandoned since i got all grumpus. and here we are!if anyone has not read this book, and is under the age of 90 while over the age of 17/senior year of high school, go immediately forth, procure this book, and read it.why? beacuse:“america is the wealthiest nation on earth, but its people are mainly poor, and poor americans are urged to hate themselves. to quote the american humorist kin hubbard, 'it ain’t no disgrace to be poor, but it might as well be.' it is in fact a crime for an american to be poor, even though america is a nation of poor. every other nation has folk traditions of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous, and therefore more estimable than anyone with power and gold. no such tales are told by the american poor. they mock themselves and glorify their betters. the meanest eating or drinking establishment, owned by a man who is himself poor, is very likely to have a sign on its wall asking this cruel question: 'if you’re so smart, why ain’t you rich?' there will also be an american flag no larger than a child’s hand – glued to a lollipop stick and flying from the cash register.americans, like human beings everywhere, believe many things that are obviously untrue. their most destructive untruth is that it is very easy for any american to make money. they will not acknowledge how in fact hard money is to come by, and, therefore, those who have no money blame and blame and blame themselves. this inward blame has been a treasure for the rich and powerful, who have had to do less for their poor, publicly and privately, than any other ruling class since, say napoleonic times. many novelties have come from america. the most startling of these, a thing without precedent, is a mass of undignified poor. they do not love one another because they do not love themselves.”that is all.\\n\\nthis work is licensed under a creative commons

                                            4.75 stars (weird rating i know, there's a reason)\"..diana puts too many murders into hers (stories she writes). she says most of the time she doesn't know what to do with the people so she kills them off to get rid of them.\"also known as: how most authors write fiction.anne of green gables is considered a canadian classic novel so it's pretty much blasphemous that i hadn't read it before now. honestly, it's a book i've always known about, but not a book i thought of. but my best friend ashlynn loves it and told me to read it, so i bought it, yet again it was never on a high priority to read list. but of course it was on my syllabus for my children literature class so i read it for class.all that being said, i loved it. it was really surprising and i had no idea what it was about but this is not really what i pictured. i still just adored it.anne herself is probably what makes this novel as good as it is. at first my initial reaction to her was \"wow this kid talks a lot!\" and she does, but like marilla, there's something endearing about it. instead of being annoyed that she talked a lot, i found myself entertained by what she was saying. she is such a dramatic, loving, hilarious child and this book had me laughing out loud by myself (in public... on the metro.. yeah it was embarrassing) several times. it's one of those books with so many hidden lessons and while the writing isn't exactly what i'd call \"for children\" i definitely see how it is aimed for children. yet, it's written in such a way that even adults can enjoy it. the best part of this book is the characters. the book is written in third person so it's not really in anne's perspective, but it feels so much like anne's perspective because she has this really positive and optimistic to viewing all humans and you just love everyone because she really makes you love them, even the characters you don't want to like or the characters she doesn't particularly like. that one particular character i'm talking about that she doesn't really like is why i docked 0.25 stars. i loved the book, and her character, but her 290 page grudge on that character really annoyed me. i really just loved this book and yes i already ordered the second one because i plan to start that one as soon as i get it because this was just so heartwarming and i loved it.    \n",

have inspired, and tolkien is no exception, but one of the biggest misconceptions about tolkien is the idea that he is somehow an 'innovator of fantasy'. he did add a number of techniques to the repertoire of epic fantasy writers, and these have been dutifully followed by his many imitators, but for the most part, these techniques are little more than bad habits.many have called tolkien by such epithets as 'the father of fantasy', but anyone who makes this claim simply does not know of the depth and history of the fantasy genre. for those who are familiar with the great and influential fantastical authors, from ovid and ariosto to eddison and dunsany to r.e. howard and fritz leiber, it is clear that, long before tolkien, fantasy was already a complex, well-established, and even a respected literary genre.eddison's work contains an invented world, a carefully-constructed (and well-researched) archaic language, a powerful and unearthly queen, and a central character who is conflicted and lost between the forces of nobility and darkness. poul anderson's \\nthe broken sword\\n, which came out the same year as the fellowship of the ring, has distant, haughty elves, deep-delving dwarves, a broken sword which must be reforged, an epic war between the armies of light and darkness, another central character trapped between those extremes, and an interweaving of christian and pagan worldviews.so, if these aspects are not unique to tolkien, then what does set him apart? though dunsany, eddison, and anderson all present worlds where light and dark come into conflict, they present these conflicts with a subtle and often ironic touch, recognizing that morality is a dangerous thing to present in absolutes. tolkien (or c.s. lewis), on the other hand, has no problem in depicting evil as evil, good as good, and the only place they meet is in the temptation of an honest heart, as in gollum's case--and even then, he is not like eddison's lord gro or anderson's scafloc, characters who live under an alternative view of the world, but instead fluctuates between the highs and lows of tolkien's dualistic morality.it is a dangerous message to make evil an external, irrational thing, to define it as 'the unknown that opposes us', because it invites the reader to overlay their own morality upon the world, which is precisely what most modern fantasy authors tend to do, following tolkien's example. whether it's goodkind's libertarianism or john norman's sex slave fetish, its very easy to simply create a magical allegory to make one side 'right' and the other side 'wrong', and you never have to develop a dramatic narrative that actually explores the soundness of those ideas. make the good guys dress in bright robes or silvery maile and the bad guys in black, spiky armor, and a lot of people will never notice that all the 'good guys' are white, upper class men, while all the 'bad guys' are 'brutish foreigners', and that both sides are killing each other and trying to rule their little corner of the world.in tolkien's case, his moral view was a very specific evocation of the ideal of 'merrie england', which is an attempt by certain stodgy old tories (like tolkien) to rewrite history so that the nobility were all good and righteous leaders, the farmers were all happy in their 'proper place' (working a simple patch of dirt), while both industrialized cultures and the 'primitives' who resided to the south and east were 'the enemy' bent on despoiling the 'natural beauty of england' (despite the fact that the isles had been flattened, deforested, and partitioned a thousand years before).though tom bombadil remains as a strangely incoherent reminder of the moral and social complexity of the fantasy tradition upon which tolkien draws, he did his best to scrub the rest clean, spending years of his life trying to fit catholic philosophy more wholly into his pagan adventure realm. but then, that's often how we think of tolkien: bent over his desk, spending long hours researching, note-taking, compiling, and playing with language. even those who admit that tolkien demonstrates certain racist, sexist, and classicist leanings (as, indeed, do many great authors) still praise the complexity of his 'world building'.and any student of the great epics, like the norse eddas, the bible, or the shahnameh can see what tolkien is trying to achieve with his worldbuilding: those books presented grand stories, but were also about depicting a vast world of philosophy, history, myth, geography, morality and culture. they were encyclopedic texts, intended to instruct their people on everything important in life, and they are extraordinarily valuable to students of anthropology and history, because even the smallest detail can reveal something about the world which the book describes.so, tolkien fills his books with troop movements, dull songs, lines of lineage, and references to his own made-up history, mythology, and language. he has numerous briefly-mentioned side characters and events because organic texts like the epics, which were formed slowly, over time and compiled from many sources often contained such digressions. he creates characters who have similar names--which is normally a stupid thing to do, as an author, because it is so confusing--but he’s trying to represent a hereditary tradition of prefixes and suffixes and shared names, which many great families of history had. so tolkien certainly had a purpose in what he did, but was it a purpose that served the story he was trying to tell?simply copying the form of reality is not what makes good art. art is meaningful--it is directed. it is not just a list of details--everything within is carefully chosen by the author to make up a good story. the addition of detail is not the same as adding depth, especially since tolkien’s world is not based on some outside system--it is whatever he says it is. it’s all arbitrary, which is why the only thing that grants a character, scene, or detail purpose is the meaning behind it. without that meaning, then what tolkien is doing is just a very elaborate thought exercise. now, it’s certainly true that many people have been fascinated with studying it, but that’s equally true of many thought exercises, such as the rules and background of the pokemon card game, or crossword puzzles.ostensibly, scrabble supposedly is a game for people who love words--and yet, top scrabble players sit an memorize lists of words whose meaning they will never learn. likewise, many literary fandom games become little more than word searches: find this reference, connect that name to this character--but which have no meaning or purpose outside of that. the point of literary criticism is always to lead us back to human thought and ideas, to looking at how we think and express ourselves. if a detail in a work cannot lead us back to ourselves, then it is no more than an arbitrary piece of chaff.the popularity of tolkien’s work made it acceptable for other authors to do the same thing, to the point that whenever i hear a book lauded for the ‘depth of its world building’, i expect to find a mess of obsessive detailing, of piling on so many inconsequential facts and figures that the characters and stories get buried under the scree, as if the author secretly hopes that by spending most of the chapter describing the hero’s cuirass, we'll forget that he’s a bland archetype who only succeeds through happy coincidence and deus ex machina against an enemy with no internal structure or motivation.when quiller-couch said authors should ‘murder their darlings’, this is what he meant: just because you have hobbies and opinions does not mean you should fill your novel with them. anything which does not materially contribute to the story, characters, and artistry of a work can safely be left out. tolkien's embarrassment of detail also produced a huge inflation in the acceptable length of fantasy books, leading to the meandering, unending series that fill bookstore shelves today.now, there are several notable critics who have lamented the unfortunate effect that tolkien’s work has had on the genre, such as in moorcock’s \\nepic pooh\\n and mieville’s diatribe about every modern fantasy author being forced to come to terms with the old don's influence. i agree with their deconstructions, but for me, tolkien isn’t some special author, some ‘fantasy granddad’ looming over all. he’s just a bump in the road, one author amongst many in a genre that stretches back thousands of years into our very ideas of myth and identity, and not one of the more interesting oneshis ideas weren’t unique, and while his approach may have been unusual, it was only because he spent a lifetime trying obsessively to make something artificial seem more natural, despite the fact that the point of fantasy (and fiction in general) is to explore the artificial, the human side of the equation, to look at the world through the biased lens of our eye and to represent some odd facet of the human condition. unfortunately, tolkien’s characters, structure, and morality are all too flat to suggest much, no matter how many faux-organic details he surrounds them with.my fantasy book suggestions   \n",

practically memorized. i don't know what it was about the characters in this book, but they appealed to me ten fold. i still can't watch the movie without reciting the lines. i think the thing i liked absolutely best about this story was that the whole time i was reading it i kept thinking, my god! this is being written by a someone my age! still a classic if you ask me.    \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    while other as-yet unreviewed classics confounded me first, heart of darkness by joseph conrad is the latest completed novel on my list of twenty to read this year to help me feel inept as a reader. at first glance, i actually thought this would be much appreciated lighter fare among some of my heftier choices. with only ninety-eight pages from start to finish, it's probably more accurately labeled a short story. those ninety-eight pages, however, took me three weeks to finish.while it didn't actually take me a long time to read, this, as my evening companion, had me choosing almost anything else over reading. tv? yes. shoveling snow? has to be done. bejewled blitz on facebook? it's only a minute (the problem arises when one turns to sixty).when i actually managed to read, the narrative was impressive. joseph conrad was polish and didn't learn english until he was twenty and working on a british merchant ship. not only did he learn english, he mastered it. the vocabulary and description are both beautiful and complex. there are also layers upon layers of metaphor. maybe too many layers. everything was darkness. the water was dark. the forest was dark. the people, chains, moonless night, smoke, room etc. etc. were dark. it felt like a bit much. sure, he had a thesaurus and used words like murky, black, shady but you still knew - he was talking about darkness. got it.upon finishing, i felt a tad superior mocking all the obvious symbolism, as if all of his dark references were the point. then, i read a few reviews from people who clearly have had an english class or ten, and they were mentioning his hidden references to greek mythology and other indirect allusions to more classics i have not read. like i always do when i'm frustrated, i complained to my mother who assured me all those nuances are what make it a classic. she made me feel better about my classics 101 level of understanding and i'm more than happy to leave heart of darkness 403 for people with greek minors. what made me like this book was the sense of accomplishment when the story was finished. conrad, with all of his darkness overkill, does not hand this story over on a platter. the narration is tricky. marlow spends the bulk of the novel speaking in first person, but, occasionally, you realize there is another narrator. it's the guy who is listening to marlow and there's probably an important reason for that shift of responsibility. that, however, is covered in heart of darkness 201. i'm going to let it go.what made me dislike this book was the sense of \"what the heck?\" when the story was finished. jay read this in high school (in high school, people!) and at one point asked me, \"so, have you been introduced to kurtz yet?\" he remembered kurtz, who, i admit, is often mentioned throughout the book. when he asked, i hadn't yet, but his and marlow's awe while mentioning his name added to an overly-hyped sense of anticipation of kurtz's contribution to conrad's novel.kurtz is hardly in the book. what he does, how he does it, where he does it all seem central to the book, but the details, those things that make sense of the rest of the plot, are never given. i know it has something to do with oppression. and racism. and evil. but, my naive little mind doesn't know how far to go. he dies saying, \"the horror! the horror!\" so, it's probably pretty bad. but i don't know! it's just all so....dark.in any case, i'm ready to move on. i'm embarrassed that this apparent high school level reading so kicked my tail. i may need to read some nicholas sparks or stephanie meyer to get some of my mojo back.   \n",

there is little to say when coming late to a classic, except this: i can’t believe it’s taken me this long to read h. g. wells! it feels a bit embarrassing. i went on a smallish time travel reading marathon near the end of last year, but i somehow managed to skip over the time machine, the grand-daddy of all modern machine-based time travel stories. perhaps i didn’t think it was necessary because i already knew the story; i watched the wishbone version when i was a kid, and i may have seen the 1960s film (and if i ever saw the 2002 adaptation--and i’m not saying i have--i certainly wouldn’t admit it). but what the wishbone version and film adaptations (including, i imagine, the most recent film--although i’m not saying i’ve seen it) all seem to lack is the sociological aspect of the story: it is not merely a wild tale of adventure through time. the world 800,000 years into the future, as the time traveler found it, is vastly different from late-eighteenth century london, but it is also a product of those times: the eloi, those small and playful people, are the atrophied descendants of the british upper-class, who over millennia of easy living devolved into weak and helpless child-creatures, who would be living in the utopia that wells’ fellow writers (morris, bellamy, and others) wrote about were it not for the morlocks, those savage, blind cannibalistic children of the eternally repressed worker class. the end result of this seemingly natural social regression is barely hinted at in the film and television adaptations of wells’ story--which i gleefully read for the first time this past week. it is one thing to know the story, but quite another to learn the context behind it.my copy of the time machine is an everyman centennial edition, which along with the novel contains notes, an appendix, a chronology of wells’ life and times, and an introduction byjohn lawton. although i usually ignore introductions in fiction, i found this, along with the chronology, as fascinating as the story itself. here, the historical context surrounding the novel, includng darwin’s and t. h. huxley’s influence on wells as well as an examination of wells’ life and times, provides for illuminating background reading about the story. no doubt any modern edition will be equally informative, and rightly so. this is a fantastic story, and i cannot recommend it enough.   \n",

there is little to say when coming late to a classic, except this: i can’t believe it’s taken me this long to read h. g. wells! it feels a bit embarrassing. i went on a smallish time travel reading marathon near the end of last year, but i somehow managed to skip over the time machine, the grand-daddy of all modern machine-based time travel stories. perhaps i didn’t think it was necessary because i already knew the story; i watched the wishbone version when i was a kid, and i may have seen the 1960s film (and if i ever saw the 2002 adaptation--and i’m not saying i have--i certainly wouldn’t admit it). but what the wishbone version and film adaptations (including, i imagine, the most recent film--although i’m not saying i’ve seen it) all seem to lack is the sociological aspect of the story: it is not merely a wild tale of adventure through time. the world 800,000 years into the future, as the time traveler found it, is vastly different from late-eighteenth century london, but it is also a product of those times: the eloi, those small and playful people, are the atrophied descendants of the british upper-class, who over millennia of easy living devolved into weak and helpless child-creatures, who would be living in the utopia that wells’ fellow writers (morris, bellamy, and others) wrote about were it not for the morlocks, those savage, blind cannibalistic children of the eternally repressed worker class. the end result of this seemingly natural social regression is barely hinted at in the film and television adaptations of wells’ story--which i gleefully read for the first time this past week. it is one thing to know the story, but quite another to learn the context behind it.my copy of the time machine is an everyman centennial edition, which along with the novel contains notes, an appendix, a chronology of wells’ life and times, and an introduction byjohn lawton. although i usually ignore introductions in fiction, i found this, along with the chronology, as fascinating as the story itself. here, the historical context surrounding the novel, includng darwin’s and t. h. huxley’s influence on wells as well as an examination of wells’ life and times, provides for illuminating background reading about the story. no doubt any modern edition will be equally informative, and rightly so. this is a fantastic story, and i cannot recommend it enough.   \n",

(if you’ve never seen this, check it out on youtube starting here -i’ve seen the movie more times than i could ever count. i’ve read gregory maguire’s wicked: the life and times of the wicked witch of the west and son of a witch (not a lion among men yet, although it is on my list) and i’ve seen the broadway production of wicked twice. heck, i’ve even experienced the bizarre synchronicity of pink floyd’s dark side of the moon and the wizard of oz! (if you’ve never seen this, check it out on youtube starting here -http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uw9ssl... – coincidence?? ;)) …yet, incredibly, i have never read the l. frank baum’s books! so after getting a free collection of all these books for my kindle, i finally decided to begin reading these classics.the wonderful wizard of oz is the first of 14 land of oz books written by l. frank baum (not to mention the 18 written by ruth plumly thompson, three by john r. neill, two by jack snow, one by rachel s. cosgrove, and one by eloise jarvis mcgraw & lauren lynn mcgraw.) with the movie, play adaptations, spoofs, and variations that have been written about this one, i hardly find a need to summarize the plot. i once again loved traveling along the yellow brick road with dorothy, toto, the scarecrow, the tin woodsman and the cowardly lion as they headed to the emerald city to seek their heart’s desire. i did find some of the plot differences between the movie and the book interesting, the biggest one being that in the book, dorothy’s journeys in oz are not ascribed to a dream at the end. i like this because it leaves the conclusion up to the reader’s imagination – the reader gets to decide whether the land of oz really exists. also, in terms of characters, we don’t meet the wicked witch of the west until the wizard sends the trio to kill her…and we don’t meet glinda, who is the good witch of the south in the book, until the end of the story (it’s the unnamed good witch of the north that dorothy first meets after her crash landing in munchkinland.) there’s also some additional characters, like the kingdom of mice who rescue the lion from the poppy field and the people made of china…and the real story behind those flying monkeys that scared the heck out of me as a child (they’re not as scary in the book…capable of scary stuff, but also capable of good).in addition to the story itself, some other things really interest me here. first of all, the whole censorship issue…i found it hard to believe that this tale, that is such an integral part of our imagination and popular culture, has actually been challenged to the extent that it has. back in the day, when the books were published, some ministers and educators were opposed to the stories, claiming they promoted witchcraft and were too fanciful. there were some who even said that the books were “ungodly” in their depiction of strong-willed & powerful female characters, an idea that was amazingly supported by many librarians. the 20th century also saw its share of anti-oz sentiments. in 1928, the chicago public library refused to put the book on its shelves, stating that the books were “not literature, but somehow evil for children.” living in florida, i find this embarrassing, but in the 1950s, florida’s state librarian, dorothy dodd, sent out a memo to all the librarians in the state denouncing the oz series, saying that they were “unwholesome for children in your community.” she took this a step further when she declared that the oz books were “not to be purchased, not to be accepted as gifts, not to be processed and not to be circulated.” …and wait…there’s more - even more recently, in 1986, fundamentalist parents in hawkins county, tn challenged the books used in local public schools, claiming that they promoted witchcraft and secular humanism. to further explain this assertion, the lead plaintiff, vicki frost, explained that the stories depicted some witches as good, while of course they are always bad. yikes! (“a federal court handed frost a limited victory by holding that the public school system would have to allow parents who objected to \"opt out\" of lessons featuring the offending literature. the u.s. 6th circuit court of appeals overturned that ruling in 1987, and the u.s. supreme court later refused to hear the case. that action led religious right attorney michael farris, who represented frost, to call on \"every born-again christian to get their children out of public schools.\" http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi...). …and the list goes on…i also always like reading about the possible underlying political symbolism in the wizard of oz. this is something that i learned in a college history course and that my daughter is learning in her ap american history class right now. before i get into it, i always kind of wondered about this. l. frank baum undoubtedly wrote these stories for children as an alternative to some of the stories that were told to him during his childhood…but he also wrote for children of all ages, stating, \"my books are intended for all those whose hearts are young, no matter what their ages may be\" (http://www.literarytraveler.com/liter...). so i think it is totally possible that baum added a little something else that would get the grownups thinking…take a look at some of this symbolism, which comes from the article lions, and tigers, and political symbols, oh my!:• dorothy: dorothy is thought to represent the american people or values. she proves herself to be determined, resourceful, and loyal. another speculation is that she represents theodore roosevelt, the united states president. some people believe this theory more than the other because of the similarities in the names. (think: dor-o-thy and the-o-dore).• toto: small and seemingly going unnoticed, toto is the one who reveals the wizard for the fraud he is. he is thought to be another representation of the average american people.• uncle henry: in the late 1800's, there was a famous farmer who was the editor of a leading farm magazine. his name was henry cantwell wallace, and everyone called him uncle henry. • cyclone: the tornado is thought to represent political upheaval, or the free silver movement. during the time period in which this story was written, farmers were suffering from federal deflation; they were receiving less money for their goods, and their debt was getting larger. they wanted the value of a dollar to have a fixed ratio of both silver and gold. some politicians were behind this movement while others were not.• munchkins: the munchkins were little people who represented the common folk. they were ordinary citizens of the united states. and in the same breath, the lollipop guild is said to represent child labor.• silver slippers: in the book, the slippers that appear on dorothy's feet are silver, rather than ruby. silver relates to the monetary political issues. farmers wanted the value of a dollar to have a fixed ratio of both gold and silver. some have also speculated that the silver slippers represent the power to vote.• yellow brick road: this represents the gold standard, such as a brick of gold. the road of gold leads to power.• oz: oz is an abbreviation for gold, which was a hot political topic with people rallying for a fixed ratio of silver and gold.• tin woodman: the tin woodman has a more obvious meaning. he represented the industrial workers who were often dehumanized. he was rusted an immobile, which is a feeling that many factory workers when businesses began shutting down because of a nation-wide depression. after losing their jobs, they felt helpless.• scarecrow: the scarecrow is thought to represent the western farmers. while his complaint was that he didn't have a brain, he ended up being the most clever problem solver of the four travelers.• cowardly lion: there was a politician named william jennings bryan in the late 1800's who supported the free silver movement. the cowardly lion is said to represent bryan, who was seen has having a loud roar, but no bite, or no power.now i plan to read baum’s other 13 books!   \n",

rubbermaids 20: failing the voight-kampff testthe on-going discoveries of priceless books and comics found in a stack of rubbermaid containers previously stored and forgotten at my parent’s house and untouched for almost 20 years. thanks to my father dumping them back on me, i now spend my spare time unearthing lost treasures from their plastic depths.in the spirit of phillip k. dick‘s questioning of reality and identity, it’s fitting that there are two versions of this story. one is the novel he wrote in which a police bounty hunter tracks down and destroys androids while he tries to earn enough money to buy a real animal to snap his wife out of a depression. the other is a film version in which a disillusioned ‘blade runner’ is forced to track down and kill dangerous replicants despite his growing sympathy for them. i also like to think that pkd would probably get a laugh because of the approximately one thousand different director’s cuts of the movie available to further confuse us as to which is the ‘real’ story.the world is pretty much a wasteland after a nuclear war, and the smart people are getting off the planet. human-like androids have been developed to help with colonizing other worlds, but they have a habit of returning to earth illegally and trying to hide. police bounty hunters use an empathy test to identify them and then kill them on the spot. rick deckard is called in after the senior bounty hunter was nearly killed while hunting a group of a new type of android. deckard is anxious for the big payday that he’d get because he’s embarrassed at not being able to afford a new animal to replace the fake sheep he bought after his real one died. he hopes that being able to get a real animal again will snap his wife out of the depression she’s in that even their mood organ device can’t fix.if you’re hoping for futuristic tech in this, you’re going to be disappointed. pkd’s strength wasn’t in envisioning what the future would look like, and the idea that deckard’s electric sheep has actual audio tape in it to simulate noises seems laughable now. flying cars and laser tubes seem like the kind of sci-fi you’d get from any pulp writer of the era.but that wasn’t the point, and pkd’s tech was always just an excuse to get at the more interesting issues of questioning reality and identity. in this one, the question is what it means to be human, and the hunt for the androids is used to explore the idea of empathy. it’s also a nice touch that with most of the animals killed by the nuclear fall-out, that owning a real one is the ultimate status symbol and any type of mistreatment is a shocking taboo. deckard longs for an animal to care for while killing things with human faces. are they too deserving of sympathy or is their humanity a mask over an overwhelming desire for self-preservation that essentially makes them all sociopaths? that’s the interesting stuff in this book.even though the blade runner movies adopts the basic story as well as several other elements, it’s not really a faithful adaptation of the book. it’s a sci-fi classic that became the template for the look of dystopian futures in film, but while the two share dna, they feel like different beings in a lot of ways. (i think that richard linklater’s rotoscoped verson of a scanner darkly is probably the best adaption of pkd’s work in capturing it’s tone and theme.)   \n",

so many layers to it- no stuffiness here!! it has a great mystery with a slight feel of horror (but classic 50s style horror, not gross gory icky horror). the main character is only identified as mrs. de winter, a young 20-something who marries the older widowed maxim de winter, and moves into his glorious estate called manderley . i loved the fact that the narrator had no name; it almost felt like i was her- or at least her companion who was by her side going through her story. i felt sorry for her, embarrassed for her, and also scared for her. there are some creepy people over in this large house. throughout her whole adjustment period into her new life she has to endure hearing stories of maxim's first wife, rebecca. everyone loved rebecca, rebecca was so beautiful, rebecca was so nice, rebecca was so sweet. but amongst the beautiful flowers in the garden and the roaring sound of the sea, something sinister lies within the walls of the majestic manderley.   \n",

(open until 6th october 2012)fourteen year old celie and her younger sister nettie are the oldest children in a large, turbulent family. their ma sickens and dies, and their pa brings home a new bride about the same age as celie. none of this stops him from taking advantage of celie and getting two babies on her, and then turning his sight onto prettier nettie. celie advises her sister to marry the older man who's interested in her, so as to escape their pa, but pa won't have it, and instead tells mr that he can have celie. mr is already a widower with three \"rotten\" children, and takes celie to look after them. nettie comes to stay, but when she resists mr's advances, he tells her she has to go. that's the last time celie sees her sister or hears from her, because she doesn't receive nettie's letters, not for the longest time.nettie is taken in by corrine and her husband, a kind reverend called samuel. their two little children, olivia and adam, were adopted though they don't know it - and they happen to be the children celie gave birth to and misses dearly. nettie is like one of the family, and after several years with them, she travels with them to africa as a missionary. there they live with a tribe called the olinka, inland off the west coast, and nettie continues to write to celie, telling her all about the olinka, her impressions of being black but not truly african, and what happens when the europeans take over the land and destroy the forest for the sake of a rubber plantation.meanwhile, celie keeps her head down in mr's house, though he beats her anyway. he's been in love with a sexy singer all his life, called shug avery, and when shug comes to live with them, celie starts falling in love with her too. celie's never had anyone in her life love her, except her sister nettie, and she believes her to be dead. but shug starts to love her back, and celie learns courage with which to change things, for her own sake.this is one very impressive, beautiful novel. i knew little about it before starting it - little more than that it gets frequently challenged in american schools by parents upset over the language and content - and had got the impression that it was one of those heavy, depressing stories where lots of bad, unpleasant things happen to women. to black women (if i was expecting anything, it was a sentimental, melodramatic, self-indulgent novel - which couldn't be further from the reality). well it does seem to start off that way, but it's really not like that at all.this is an epistolary novel, told in diary entries by celie to god, and then later to nettie, and in letters from nettie to celie. walker writes with incredible skill: in the beginning, celie's entries are short and poorly written, her thoughts leaping without apparent connection, so that it is like picking up puzzle pieces off the floor and trying to match them up. it is hard to get a sense of time passing (she states her age, fourteen, at the beginning, but it's not much of a marker for how much time has passed between entries, or how old she is when things happen), and of events because she'll just suddenly mention something, and it's hard to tell if it's happening \"now\" or was from the past - her grammar is that bad. but her voice is strong with her personality, even if her personality isn't a strong one: she's not like sofia, her step-son's wife, who's big and strong and confident and punches back when harpo tries to put her in line by beating her. you get plenty of mental exercise, reading this book, reading between the lines and piecing things together, but as celie's writing improves along with her situation, it becomes much easier to follow things. she always retains her wonderful voice, though, with its distinct diction and phonetic spelling which always gets across the colour and flavour of the setting, the other characters, how they feel.this time kate [mr's sister] come by herself. she maybe twenty-five. old maid. she look younger than me. healthy. eyes bright. tongue sharp.buy celie some clothes. she say to mr.___________.she need clothes? he ast.well look at her.he look at me. it like he looking at the earth. it need somethin? his eyes say.she go with me in the store. i think what color shug avery would wear. she like a queen to me so i say to kate, somethin purple, maybe little red in it too. but us look an look and no purple. plenty red but she say, naw, he won't want to pay for red. too happy lookin. we got choice of brown, maroon or navy blue. i say blue.i can't remember being the first one in my own dress. now to have one made just for me. i try to tell kate what it mean. i git hot in the face and stutter.she say. it's all right, celie. you deserve more than this.maybe so. i think. [pp.20-21]there is so much going on in this book, it's hard to know where to start. set sometime during the first world war, at the beginning, it ends during the second world war. it is somewhere in the american south, but i don't remember it clearly saying where exactly - other cities and states are referred to, but not where celie lives. it is of course after the abolition of slavery, but segregation and prejudice thrives. there is a strong sense of realism, from the way the characters talk (everyone is black unless mentioned otherwise), to the things that happen to them. through the characters' voices, walker is brutally honest and unflinching in her depiction of life for black people in the american south, and elsewhere.this is a story about emancipation of the soul: celie especially grows a great deal over the course of the novel, from a quiet, beaten down girl who believes what the abusive men in her life say about her, who believes as a matter of course in the god that is preached at her in church, into a mature woman who - still quietly - takes charge of her life and makes something of it. it is a story about the strength of women, and about the gender stereotypes that hold back both women and men - the men are almost caricatures of lazy, stubborn, demanding, superior beings who think women are not good for much, without recognising that they do all the work and are often simply too afraid to speak up for themselves (and the men wouldn't listen anyway).harpo want to know what to do to make sofia mind. he sit out on the porch with mr._________. he say, i tell her one thing, she do another. never do what i say. always backtalk.to tell the truth, he sound a little proud of this to me.mr._________ don't say nothing. blow smoke.i tell her she can't be all the time going to visit her sister. us married now, i tell her. your place is here with the children. she say, i'll take the children with me. i say, your place is with me. she say, you want to come? she keep primping in front of the glass, getting the children ready at the same time.you ever hit her? mr._________ ast.harpo look down at his hands. naw suh, he say low, embarrass.well how you spect to make her mind? wives is like children. you have to let 'em know who got the upper hand. nothing can do that better than a good sound beating.he puff on his pipe.sofia think too much of herself anyway, he say. she need to be taken down a peg. [p.35]of course, what comes across to the reader is the irony: that it's the men who behave like children in celie's world: petulant, sulky, unhelpful, abusive - okay that's not children, but you get what i mean. it was just beautiful to me, seeing the principle male characters also grow and change, partly forced to it by the women who find their strength, and how much more content and happier they are when they're no longer lazy and abusive and neglectful. i warmed to them all. none of the characters are black-and-white - although, the only real white people who feature, the mayor and his family, are sketches of white prejudice and privilege - and it is in their complex shades of grey that walker excels at bringing them to life.another aspect is the dichotomy, if i can call it that, of black people - the ones sold by their own people to white slavers and shipped to the american colonies, and the \"real\" africans in africa. it is impressive, what walker managed to capture and articulate in such a relatively short novel. in one of nettie's letters to celie, while en route to africa from england, she says:although africans once had a better civilization than the european ... for several centuries they have fallen on hard times. \"hard times\" is a phrase the english love to use, when speaking of africa. and it is easy to forget that africa's \"hard times\" were made harder by them. millions and millions of africans were captured and sold into slavery - you and me, celie! and whole cities were destroyed by slave catching wars. today the people of africa - having murdered or sold into slavery their strongest folks - are riddled by disease and sunk in spiritual and physical confusion. they believe in the devil and worship the dead. nor can they read or write.why did they sell us? how could they have done it? and why do we still love them? [p.139]the juxtaposition of the black descendants of slaves in america with the \"original\" africans on their ancestral land, is vivid and fascinating. nettie is bright, well educated (self educated), kind, generous and open-minded. and she conjures spectacular visions:the capital city of senegal is dakar and the people speak their own language, senegalese i guess they would call it, and french. they are the blackest people i have ever seen, celie. they are black like the people we are talking about when we say, \"so and so is blacker than black, he's blueblack.\" they are so black, celie, they shine. which is something else folks down home like to say about real black folks. but celie, try to imagine a city full of these shining, blueblack people wearing brilliant blue robes with designs l...   \n",

i could have just stated the song and moved on with the review, or i could be honest about some failing on my part that no one probably needs to know (would i be a more better awesomest top reviewer full of win if i just stopped with all of this 'honesty' painting myself as some hapless moron nonsense, what if i used product in my hair? i dream of being more like mr. elliot (father or cousin, now that i think of it, but cousin was in my mind when i said that))(still in a parentheses in case your wondering). for years, like five of them or so, i've misattributed this song to being a psychedelic furs song, not just as originally done by them and then covered by jawbreaker, but as in the version i was hearing in my head as by the psychedelic furs and not a cover version performed by my favorite band ever. what an awful fan i am. although i've never been that big on the etc., collection where this can be found, nor ever interested in rem enough to purchase more than two or three of their albums, nevermind a tribute cd to them (and yes, \"pretty persuasion\" is on one of the rem records i own (although thinking about rem now i realize that i only ever bought one rem record, the other two i owned were given to me as christmas gifts (you needed to know this information, seriously)))). if i had ever gone through with tattooing the four f's on to my arm or leg like i really meant to have done i would be right now burning the tattoo off of my body with the cooking flame throwing thing my sister gave me for christmas in 2009 instead of writing this review). so this book has the soundtrack of blake rasping, \"goddamn pretty persuasion\" in my head pretty much anytime that i see or think about the book. i think this is an ok thing, i could totally see anne as listening to jawbreaker if the story had been set in the 1990's or 2000's instead of the early nineteenth century.*part of me wants to just write a review calling this a romance novel, just to incite some of my goodreads friends, but i won't do that. if this were a romance novel i think it would be fairly unsatisfying. the ending felt sort of like a foregone conclusion from the first couple of chapters (although i'm not the target audience for romances, and my guess is that most readers of romance novels can kind of guess the ending to just about any romance novel, and i guess it's the route taken or something that makes them interesting, i don't know. i am not someone to ask anything related to romance about (most un-romantic thing i've ever done? told my sophomore year college girlfriend (maybe i will relate more tales from this relationship some other time when i'm at a loss for personal shit to divulge instead of actually writing about the book i'm supposed to be reviewing) soon after returning to school in january how i wasn't going to get her anything for valentines day because it was just a consumer holiday designed to sell crap to people. unromantic? i then made sure to harp on my refusing to take part in valentines day almost daily up until the actual day), see? what do i know about romance). instead i was surprised (i guess, i don't know what i was expecting from jane austen actually) to find the book a lot like the fun parts of proust. her characters were as comically stuffy, delusional and as interesting as the various people who populated the drawing rooms of marcel's social world. but unlike proust's marcel, anne is sort of the rational calm in the middle of the storm of personalities and not a borderline sociopath who is critical but really right at home with all of the other psychological malcontents populating the novel. i really liked the book and this is a very strong four star rating. my only complaint with the book, and what probably kept it from getting the fifth star, is the style of writing, which is more the conventions of the time than the actual content. but i would proudly bring this book or maybe even another jane austen novel with me to a future ufc event and maybe even sit and read a few pages in between fights while some remix of rage against the machine with extra hip-hop beats was played at teeth rattling volumes, and i would have no problem asking some passing mma personality for an autograph and open up jane austen to the title page to get their john hancock. like anne and her feelings about her broken engagement to captain wentworth i'll be regretting not getting skyscrape** from tapout or trainer greg jackson to sign and make my copy of jane austen the most badass on the planet until i can rectify this situation. i only hope it doesn't take eight years of pining before i get the chance to set things right. *another band i could see the modern day anne listening to (yes, she's been projected to being some kind of cool but unnoticed indie girl in my reimagining) would be the other band that supplies a soundtrack to the shelving of a jane austen book. that would be (obviously) belle and sebastian's \"just a modern rock song\" for emma (\"emma tried to run away, i followed her across the city\"). **greg jackson looks like a normal person, so i'm not going to share a picture of him, but this is what skyscrape looks like:doesn't he look like the type of guy who just needs have his signature saved in a jane austen book?

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          the word persuasion appears thirteen times in jane austen's first novel, sense and sensibility. it appears only seven times in her last novel, although her brother henry, who published it posthumously, chose it as the title. i'm guessing that austen might have objected to this because her novel is about so much more than the merits and demerits of pliability as a characteristic. i was struck by many things as i read this poolside in delray beach, florida- a twenty-first century bath. as always, miss austen is her wickedly sardonic self, and the tone of the novel seems both elegiac and radical. her heroine, anne elliot has good sense, a kind heart, a delicate, fading beauty...and the worst relatives ever imagined! her widowed father, a baronet, and her two sisters are vain, vapid narcissists without an ounce of sense between them. sir walter is a piece of work, a preening peacock who is as mean-spirited as he is stupid, having squandered the family fortune. austen is no friend to the nobility - lady catherine de bourgh and lady bertram are famous objects of her derision - but no one is as despicable as sir walter elliot, or as duplicitous as his cousin and eventual heir, william elliot. she has great fun mocking them, but she also reminds us that poor anne must suffer embarrassment for them, humiliation by them and the loss of her beloved home because of them.\\n\\nthis being a classic cinderella story, anne requires a prince charming to rescue her. she had broken her engagement to a poor young man years before, having been persuaded by others that he was beneath her. he returns triumphantly as the rich captain wentworth, a naval hero in search of a wife. he has persuaded himself that anne's past behavior was unforgivable and he seems to be rubbing her nose in it. his circle of friends, naval officers and their wives, provides a sharp contrast to the aristocracy. as i read, i wondered what austen might have thought if she'd been privy to herman melville's, billy budd, sailor but concluded that she is entitled to her romantic notions and, besides, it serves her larger mission to elevate one class as she denigrates another. she isn't just nitpicking here; her nobles are as ignoble as anyone invented by charles dickens or f. scott fitzgerald. i'd like to think that austen would be sympathetic to the occupy wall street crowd but truthfully, she might have just as easily become a tea party radical. she sees nothing wrong with great wealth if it is used to good ends and if the wealthy are of good character. what makes reading this such a pleasure is the comforting idea that anyone can recover from youthful mistakes, and that second chances are not only possible, but are desirable outcomes for people who are open to

as the experts say - were experimenting more in writing.the story that she narrates has many autobiographical details. its main core, which is surely inspired by her brother's professional career in the navy, is the life of some of his colleagues at the end of the napoleonic wars, a life that drastically changes and pushes some to seek a life on the land where they can enjoy the profits they had earned but also the highest social status and the prestige offered by their services for their country. this social rise is described by the writer through the case of a navy officer who once made a marriage proposal to a young woman of the aristocracy, our heroine, but despite her initial positive response, she was persuaded by her familly to refuse because they considered his social position much lower. years later this couple is meeting again and things seem to be completely different. the only thing that does not change is the feelings that unite them - or divide them - which remain the same.there is the other autobiographical element as the writer had passed the stage of a woman unmarried at the age of 27, where women of the time decided to definitively take on the role of the spinster who lives only to serve others. this life of the spinster she is presenting us in her own brilliant way, with a strong self-sarcastic mood that leads to many delightful literary moments. of course at this age marriage was not unthinkable, there were still chances, but what changed was the fact that the situation was considered urgent and the pressure to accept any proposal led to funny situations and sad thoughts. of course, these suggestions were obviously not the best and their motives were not always honest, as - as the book says - the competition from younger and prettier women was intense unless, of course, there was love in the middle.all this makes this book very interesting, but my particular love for it is by the fact that, despite its sarcastic character, i find in it a greater dose of tenderness. the meeting of the two old lovers takes place in a climate of delightful embarrassment and their relationship continues through remorse and successive flushes when emotions become stronger. from the cute physical manifestations of love, we go into thoughts about the nature of this beautiful feeling, ending in its very touching effect that has between a man and a woman, however different they approach love. in the end there is the classic romantic view that manifests with the writer's love for nature and more for the sea, which is constantly crossed by people honest and truthful. with all of this, it is impossible for me not to be totally excited reaching the last page.το γράψιμο μιας κριτικής για αυτό το βιβλίο είναι μία κάπως μελαγχολική υποχρέωση καθώς σκέφτομαι ότι ήταν το τελευταίο βήμα μιας λαμπρής συγγραφικής πορείας που διακόπηκε πολύ πρόωρα. κανείς δεν ξέρει πόσα ακόμα αριστουργήματα θα είχε γράψει και σε ποια μονοπάτια θα οδηγούσαν γενικότερα τη λογοτεχνία. αυτό που ξέρουμε διαβάζοντας αυτό το βιβλίο είναι ότι η μεγάλη συγγραφέας είχε σκοπό να σαλπάρει για διαφορετικές θάλασσες καθώς ασχολούνταν με διαφορετικά θέματα και - όπως λένε οι ειδικοί - πειραματίζονταν περισσότερο με τον τρόπο γραφής της.ιστορία που αφηγείται έχει πολλά αυτοβιογραφικά στοιχεία. ο βασικός κορμός της, που σίγουρα είναι εμπνευσμένος από την επαγγελματική σταδιοδρομία του αδελφού της στο ναυτικό είναι η ζωή κάποιων συναδέλφων του μετά το τέλος των ναπολεόντειων πολέμων, μία ζωή που φυσικά αλλάζει δραστικά και ωθεί κάποιους να αναζητήσουν μία ζωή στη στεριά όπου θα μπορούν να απολαύσουν τα κέρδη που είχαν αποκομίσει αλλά και την υψηλότερη κοινωνική θέση και το πρεστίζ που τους προσέφεραν οι υπηρεσίες τους στην πατρίδα. αυτήν την κοινωνική άνοδο περιγράφει η συγγραφέας μέσα από την περίπτωση ενός ναυτικού που κάποτε έκανε πρόταση γάμου σε μία νεαρή γυναίκα της αριστοκρατίας, την ηρωίδα μας, αλλά παρά την αρχική θετική της απάντηση πείστηκε από τους δικούς της να αρνηθεί γιατί θεωρούσαν ότι η κοινωνική του θέση ως αξιωματικός του ναυτικού ήταν πολύ χαμηλότερη. αργότερα, μετά από χρόνια, αυτό το ζευγάρι ξανασυναντιέται και τα πράγματα φαίνεται να είναι εντελώς διαφορετικά. το μόνο που δεν αλλάζει είναι τα συναισθήματα που τους ενώνουν - ή τους χωρίζουν -, τα οποία παραμένουν το ίδιο έντονα. εκεί είναι και το άλλο αυτοβιογραφικό στοιχείο καθώς η συγγραφέας είχε περάσει από το στάδιο μιας γυναίκας ανύπαντρης στην ηλικία των 27 ετών, όπου οι γυναίκες της εποχής αποφάσιζαν οριστικά να πάρουν το ρόλο της γεροντοκόρης που ζει μόνο για να εξυπηρετεί τους άλλους. αυτή τη ζωή της γεροντοκόρης την παρουσιάζει με τον δικό της πανέξυπνο τρόπο, με μία έντονη αυτοσαρκαστική διάθεση που οδηγεί σε πολλά απολαυστικά λογοτεχνικά στιγμιότυπα. βέβαια σε αυτήν την ηλικία ο γάμος δεν ήταν κάτι το αδιανόητο, υπήρχαν και τότε ευκαιρίες, αυτό, όμως, που άλλαζε ήταν το γεγονός ότι η κατάσταση θεωρούνταν επείγουσα και η πίεση για αποδοχή οποιασδήποτε πρότασης οδηγούσε σε αστείες καταστάσεις αλλά και σε λυπητερές σκέψεις. φυσικά αυτές οι προτάσεις προφανώς δεν ήταν και οι καλύτερες και τα κίνητρά τους δεν ήταν πάντοτε τίμια καθώς - όπως φαίνεται και στο βιβλίο - ο ανταγωνισμός από νεότερες και ομορφότερες γυναίκες ήταν έντονος, εκτός αν, φυσικά, υπήρχε ο έρωτας στη μέση.όλα αυτά κάνουν αυτό το βιβλίο να είναι πολύ ενδιαφέρον αλλά ο δικός μου λόγος μου το αγάπησα ιδιαίτερα είναι το γεγονός ότι, παρά τον σαρκαστικό του χαρακτήρα, εντοπίζω μέσα σε αυτό μία μεγαλύτερη δόση τρυφερότητας. η συνάντηση των δύο παλιών εραστών γίνεται μέσα σε ένα κλίμα αξιαγάπητης αμηχανίας και η σχέση τους συνεχίζεται μέσα από τύψεις και αλλεπάλληλα κοκκινίσματα όταν τα συναισθήματα γίνονται εντονότερα. από τις χαριτωμένες σωματικές εκδηλώσεις του έρωτα περνάμε σε σκέψεις για τη φύση αυτού του όμορφο αισθήματος, καταλήγοντας στην πολύ συγκινητική επίδραση μου έχει ανάμεσα σε έναν άντρα και σε μία γυναίκα, όσο διαφορετικά και αν τον προσεγγίζουν. στο τέλος υπάρχει και ο κλασικός ρομαντισμός που εκδηλώνεται με την αγάπη της συγγραφέως για τη φύση και περισσότερο για τη θάλασσα, την οποία διασχίζουν συνεχώς άνθρωποι τίμιοι και ειλικρινείς. με όλα αυτά μου είναι αδύνατο να μην είμαι απόλυτα συγκινημένος φτάνοντας στην τελευταία σελίδα.   \n",
       "56037                                                                                                                                                                                  i don't put pics or gifs in reviews, but right now i've got a mental image of a non-specific peanuts character running round in small circles, arms up, mouth open, going: yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!!i finished this. when i decided last year that actually, yes, i would read anna karenina, (of which i'd had copies on and off since c.2002) i planned to start a post by saying i was one of the few people who'd ever started the book because of - not in spite of - all the material about rural life and agriculture.actually, there wasn't nearly enough of it relative to the amount of society conversation.anyway. i've said most of what i want to say about anna karenina elsewhere. if you can be arsed reading lots of snippets, it's:- in my comments on two threads started by others (pasted now, not just linked - i've been careful not to include other people's words, but my comments are still indebted to them, having been bounced off them):junei was reading that bit [the mowing scene] yesterday, so the detail about the scythes is esp. appreciated. whichever version though, it's still awesome to read that scene on a lawn in the sunshine.as said elsewhere i am reading p&v [fnar] but just because i already had it and didn't greatly prefer the newer translations i looked at (eg bartlett, schwartz). perhaps there are scenes which different translators do better, and garnett came out tops on this one.they have not annoyed me as much so far in ak as in w&p, although the term 'self-esteem' in a conversation between levin and his half brother jarred. would sound out of place for 1975, never mind 1875. whatever happened to 'self-respect'? ---------the descriptions of countryside & gardens are my favourite thing about tolstoy. (in w&p e.g. the sleigh ride and christmas, and when andrei[?]rides to bald hills during the war.) -----------i had searched for food in anna karenina, wondering if a blogger had perhaps cooked and photographed some.found this other translation of a paragraph (garnett? not sure.)http://www.russianfoods.com/en/peasan...it sounds unappetising, would probably never have searched for the food if i'd read that first off.it may of course just be the naming of dishes, e.g. \"little patties\" sounds like corned beef. and goose is hard work to cook and not, imo quite worth the effort. [not always been vegetarian]the dreaded pevear & volokhonsky:the efforts of agafya mikhailovna and the cook to make an especially good dinner had as their only result that the two hungry friends, sitting down to the hors d'oeuvres, ate their fill of bread and butter, polotok and pickled mushrooms, and that levin ordered the soup served without the pirozhki, with which the cook had wanted especially to to surprise the guest. but stepan arkadyevich, though accustomed to different dinners, found everything excellent: the herb liqueur, and the bread and butter, and, especially the polotok, the mushrooms, the nettle soup, the chicken with white sauce, and the white crimean wine - everything was excellent and wonderful.--------'polotok' is footnoted. i prefer that - plenty of local terms and explanations instead of trying to anglicise everything.in the same way, 'dumplings' would bring to mind something like these:http://jensfoodandphotos.blogspot.co....so would rather they say 'pirozhki'.septemberi'm afraid i got exasperated with ak and have...35% still to go after several phases of reading it this year. not something i'm expecting many to agree with on gr.lev can be so victorian sometimes and that quote sounds like one of those moments.and then there's the accidental innuendo side, which i can't help reading in because of the scene with kitty and the doctor. (not actually p&v's fault that time...) ---------usually i've been all for arguing for historical context and concomitant patience - e.g. that these characters couldn't help it due to social conditioning and also because of having their breathing and movement restricted by corsets and crinolines.but i got fed up with it in ak regardless. i was just bloody sick of reading about them. maybe the patience i thought i'd always had has a limit of 4-500 pages.then re. the affair plot, similar. tired of hearing about these people pacing round and round, encaged by a broken system - someone just invent polyamory already ffs.also could never forget that they were invented creatures of tolstoy's mind, this pompous paterfamilias; couldn't think about them as real, any opinions i might have of them couldn't be anything other than tentative: tired of wondering what was tolstoy and what was representative of real russian c.1870s women.wanted to be reading memoir instead, to be without that sort of complication...the old popular idea of being a \"tolstoy person\" or a \"dostoevsky person\" seems to be a false dichotomy among familiar people on gr, but i think i'm the latter: i wanted to hear more about the run-down political activist brother, about the servants. almost anyone seemed more interesting than the main characters...i wouldn't be surprised if the level of repression was such that a writer wouldn't be fully conscious if the innuendo. he sowed his wild oats but he seems to have been so caught up in his ideals and his idea of how and who he wanted to be, that there wasn't room for seeing himself otherwise.but tolstoy is still less prudish than his british contemporaries and includes things it would have been improper for them to. which is interesting imo.although one surprising aspect of the book was how normal anna and vronsky were - average members of their class who got hijacked by passionate love. the tone of the book seems to reflect that they have always been conventional conformists apart from this. but in the end i enjoyed more florid stories of such affairs, romanticism, where the writing was more sympathetic to the characters, less detached, more swept up in the moment e.g. confession of a child of the century.... i think i ... look for a particular idea of russianness, and dostoevsky satisfies that for me, whereas tolstoy - whilst interesting to know about and obviously a major part of the culture - i find too similar to english victorian to love. --------- i hadn't been able to articulate why the idea of an orrery [which i used in my war & peace review] wasn't entirely positive (they are pretty little machines) - but yes, the lack of chaos, or the feel of that, and the attendant excitement is what's missing. one or two unexpected things did happen later in the book, but it was soon back to business as usual.i also think of formal dances to represent the structure of some classic novels: usually an image from some tv adaptation...from the little i've read (there was no shortage of russian novels in the house when i was growing up, but only recently started reading any for myself) my impression is of some things speeded up, some things slowed down as compared with w. euro history. during ak, serfdom has been abolished for only about 10 years, but the more progressive side of the dinner party discussion about women's education and role in society is more modern than anything i remember seeing in british novels of the same age. the lack of prudery could equally seem c18th or c20th compared with britain depending on how one looks at it - my impression is they skipped some of the extremes of victorian english morality, but so did much of the continent. i haven't really read russian social history either, but imperial russians, including characters in conversation later in ak, thought of themselves as behind the west in many respects and eager to catch up.most of the c19th lit i've read was in my early to mid teens (>20yrs ago, argh). now perhaps i think more actively about the downsides of that world, and feel more strongly an idea of what it might have been like to be in it, rather than just passively accepting that's how things were.---------this discussion has persuaded me to pick up anna karenina again; now a whole extra 10% further forward, nearly at the end of part vi. the novel seems like less of a burden after this. i think i only really love tolstoy when he writes about countryside and scenery - i'm too rarely sure about the people - so his two big books will be quite enough for me. - detailed notes and occasional rants whilst reading:a) for parts i-v in the status updates below the review box (includes smutty interpretation of a scene featuring kitty). b) for parts vi-viii in three comments below. (both sets of summaries are pretty detailed; i've only treated events that surprised me most as spoilers - didn't mention them directly or used spoiler tags.)for months, up to this week, i'd associated my boredom of the characters with an almost physical sense of having a couple of dozen crumpled-paper balls thrown at me, by goodreads collectively. after the second of those two conversations, that entirely disappeared. (gr thread as talking therapy?... anyway, am grateful to find sympathy somewhere for a minority opinion like this one). i read on, now contentedly accepting that i would not get much enjoyment from, or want to pay excruciating attention to the detail of, the endless drawing room and gentlemen's club conversations.yes, fellow non-fans of pevear and volokhonsky, this was their translation, but i don't think that made much difference. in their war & peace i was irritated by word choices and sentence structures, but here it was more fundamental: personalities, settings, cumulative attitudes that couldn't be so very different in another translation.this won't be a popular opinion - and after months i gloriously do not feel that as any burden or embarrassment - but i think i've had enough of tolstoy now. after all, w&p + ak = more pages and more time than i've spent with many of my favourite authors.   \n",

supposed to like more than you would on its merits alone. i certainly appreciate hurston's place in american cultural history, and the importance of the movement to which this novel belongs. the tense last 30 pages or so saved it for me a little, and i always appreciate expanding my base of cultural knowledge. that said, i just didn't enjoy the book very much, in my own subjective way.hurston was apparently praised for her realistic depiction of southern african-american vernacular, but i found it really tough to get through all the \"ah\"s and \"tuh\"s. i also found the pacing to be very uneven. rambling internal monologues* occupy long stretches, where important events are introduced and glossed over abruptly. (view spoiler)[when janie and tea cake first move to jacksonville, he steals her money and disappears for a night of partying on the town, but it's all forgotten instantly when he says he was just embarrassed about the people he usually associates with. tea cake decides to start beating her to show, um, that he loves her and to illustrate to outside threats that he is in control of their relationship, and after two or three pages it's never mentioned again. janie shoots a rabid tea cake at the end, then she goes on trial, then the townspeople all turn on her, then she gets acquitted, then the townspeople all apologize, then she goes home to eatonville, the end. (hide spoiler)] it just seemed to lack a coherent narrative - why introduce such important plot elements, if they are just going to be glossed over?really, the circumstances surrounding the novel's creation, and hurston herself, are far more interesting to me. she wrote the book while in haiti on a guggenheim fellowship to study vodou. she had been living in new york, embroiled in a passionate relationship with a man twenty years her junior, and as a fiercely independent woman saw the trip as an opportunity to cut the relationship off. (at least that's the story provided by hurston biographer valerie boyd at the end of the book.) i think i would enjoy the work that came out of her studies, tell my horse, much more. * example, p. 90:most humans didn’t love one another nohow, and this mislove was so strong that even common blood couldn’t overcome it all the time. she had found a jewel down inside herself and she had wanted to walk where people could see her and gleam it around. but she had been set in the market-place to sell. been set for still-bait. when god had made the man, he made him out of stuff that sung all the time and glittered all over. then after that some angels got jealous and chipped him into millions of pieces, but still he glittered and hummed. so they beat him down to nothing but sparks but each little spark had a shine and a song. so they covered each one over with mud. and the lonesomeness in the sparks make them hunt for one another, but the mud is deaf and dumb. like all the other tumbling mud-balls, janie had tried to show her shine.say what now?   \n",

              this, along with the other narnia books, i read aloud to my daughters as a bedtime story over several weeks. it's surprising how captivating they find it. i'm a bit embarrassed to say that it's my first time with the series, i somehow couldn't be bothered to read much before i was 18 or so, and so the period of my youth when it would have been most fascinating to me was already past. they are good, classic adventures with all sorts of funny stuff going on. a few of the scenes of dancing and revelry in the forest in this one were downright surreal.    \n",

honestly, i wasn't moved. not that i need to be moved by a book to appreciate it but... i didn't feel kino's culture. steinbeck just didn't give it to me, kind of the way that thornton wilder misses the peruvian culture in the bridge of san luis rey. these white guys just don't get it - coming from a white guy. anyway, i enjoyed the descriptions of the pearl buyers. there's nothing like a fat drooling capitalist to get your point across. but i already know that the 'underclass' is fooled - and has been fooled for time immemorial - by something or other, whether it's religion or tv or the lottery or those pesky pearl purchasers. in any case, i should've read this, and many other steinbeck classics, years ago. it would've been more effective, and more enjoyable.   \n",

               all the starsthis book seemingly had three strikes against it, before i even cracked open the spine. first off, as i’ve stated numerous times before, i’m not a fan of war stories. and i especially don’t care to revisit vietnam, so soon after wading through king’s hearts in atlantis. secondly, nonfiction is not my thing . . . at all. that dry, voiceless prose or lengthy expository info dumps, which seem to populate many works, are dead boring. i’d much rather be whisked away into some page-turning adventure. the third and final strike is that, although i’ve read plenty of these short story collections over the last few years, i’m still not entirely sold on their overall merit. short little vignettes are fine for casual browsing, but i've always preferred a lengthier tale to properly flesh out the characters. all these preconceived notions, yet i couldn't rid my thoughts of something jeff said early on in his read through–and i’m paraphrasing here–“so far, this is an absolutely breathtaking read, check out that titular story and you'll be hooked.” i also vaguely remember amanda's ringing endorsement from a few years back, which put this on my radar to begin with. so rather begrudgingly, i finally picked up the book to see what all the fuss was about. now, i’m happy to report, before god and country, that all those prejudices were unwarranted. this book just flat out works. while technically this may be a categorized as a short story collection, in reality, all of the individual tales interweave and overlap to tell a broader, more powerful and poignant story. the same could be said of truth and fiction. o’brien has no qualms about mixing half-truths or even outright falsehoods into an otherwise faithful recounting of events. or is any of it true? who’s to say, other than the people that were actually there? however, he isn't trying to fool us or have us playing some guessing game. rather, he employs this technique in an attempt to get at the heart of the matter. to get at what he likes to refer to as “story-truth.” he wants you to feel what he felt, experience it firsthand, and in order to accomplish that you have to realize that sometimes “story-truth” is truer than “happening-truth.” whatever the method, the results are undeniable. some of the harrowing scenes described in this book will stick to your bones. much like the horrors witnessed or perpetrated by the soldiers themselves, they’ll not easily be scrubbed away. or what about that intense out-of-body feeling of aliveness you experience after a firefight? how you find yourself studying the vivid colors of the grass and the trees and the river. how you're awed by the sunset, and “filled with a hard, aching love for how the world could be and always should be, but now is not.” o’brien also addresses the lasting impact the war has had on all their lives. to truly appreciate the soldiers’ plight you need to become conscious of the fact that it doesn’t end on the battlefield. perusing this story, i found myself highlighting huge passages, which are much too long to include in any review, so i’ll simply implore you, if you’re anything like me, to set aside those preconceived notions and pick up this book. you won’t regret it. this masterpiece would make a welcome addition to any collection.5 stars – i’m off to track down a hardcover of my own.on second thought, for anyone curious to sample his writing or believe me to be overselling it, check the spoiler for a couple of lengthy quotes from said titular story. (view spoiler)[they carried all the emotional baggage of men who might die. grief, terror, love, longing—these were intangibles, but the intangibles had their own mass and specific gravity, they had tangible weight. they carried shameful memories. they carried the common secret of cowardice barely restrained, the instinct to run or freeze or hide, and in many respects, this was the heaviest burden of all, for it could never be put down, it required perfect balance and perfect posture. they carried their reputations. they carried the soldier's greatest fear, which was the fear of blushing. men killed and died because they were embarrassed not to. it was what had brought them to the war in the first place, nothing positive, no dreams of glory or honor, just to avoid the blush of dishonor. they died so as not to die of embarrassment. they crawled into tunnels and walked point and advanced under fire. each morning, despite the unknowns, they made their legs move. they endured. they kept humping. they did not submit to the obvious alternative, which was simply to close the eyes and fall. so easy, really. go limp and tumble to the ground and let the muscles unwind and not speak and not budge until your buddies picked you up and lifted you into the chopper that would roar and dip its nose and carry you off to the world. a mere matter of falling, yet no one ever fell. it was not courage, exactly; the object was not valor. rather, they were too frightened to be cowards.. . .at night, on guard, staring into the dark, they were carried away by jumbo jets. they felt the rush of takeoff. gone! they yelled. and then velocity—wings and engines—a smiling stewardess—but it was more than a plane, it was a real bird, a big sleek silver bird with feathers and talons and high screeching. they were flying. the weights fell off; there was nothing to bear. they laughed and held on tight, feeling the cold slap of wind and altitude, soaring, thinking it's over, i'm gone!—they were naked, they were light and free—it was all lightness, bright and fast and buoyant, light as light, a helium buzz in the brain, a giddy bubbling in the lungs as they were taken up over the clouds and the war, beyond duty, beyond gravity and mortification and global entanglements—sin loi!, they yelled. i'm sorry, motherfuckers, but i'm out of it, i'm goofed, i'm on a space cruise, i'm gone!

youth, bravely and forthrightly, without thought of personal loss or discredit. certainly that was my conviction back in the summer of 1968. tim o'brien: a secret hero. the lone ranger. if the stakes ever became high enough—if the evil were evil enough, if the good were good enough—i would simply tap a secret reservoir of courage that had been accumulating inside me over the years. courage, i seemed to think, comes to us in finite quantities, like an inheritance, and by being frugal and stashing it away and letting it earn interest, we steadily increase our moral capital in preparation for that day when the account must be drawn down. it was a comforting theory. it dispensed with all those bothersome little acts of daily courage; it offered hope and grace to the repetitive coward; it justified the past while amortizing the future. a teacher friend in the u.s mentioned that this is one of the books she covers in her senior ap lit class. so a shout out to my friend athena for her recommendation! the things they carried reminded me of my experience reading lonesome dove. although completely opposite in subject- one being the american west and the other, vietnam in 1968, what strikes me about both is that the authors are leading us into the world of men. how they think, feel, speak, joke, and deal with the memories of a war that many would prefer to forget. it is unabashedly a male world that i as a female reader was entering. or should i say a female reader that has never fought in a war? what would be the lesson that tim o'brien would try to teach me?  a true war story is never moral. it does not instruct, nor encourage virtue, nor suggest models of proper human behavior, nor restrain men from doing the things men have always done. if a story seems moral, do not believe it. if at the end of a war story you feel uplifted, or if you feel that some small bit of rectitude has been salvaged from the larger waste, then you have been made the victim of a very old and terrible lie. there is no rectitude whatsoever. there is no virtue. as a first rule of thumb, therefore, you can tell a true war story by its absolute and uncompromising allegiance to obscenity and evil.the things they carried is a brutally raw and honest insight into the experiences before, during, and after the war. this is author tim o'brien's soldier experience in vietnam. he shares the stories of the men that he knew and the ghosts that he lives with decades after his time. being raised by a canadian father that came of age during that war, my parents home library had a series by time magazine on vietnam and my dad showed my brother and i( as teenagers not as small children) some of the hollywood classics like \"platoon,\"\" full metal jacket,\" apocalypse now\" etc. so i knew that tim o'brien's recollections were not going to be cookie-cutter memories. if you read it, please understand that this book doesn't back down from the \"not so pretty \"    you can tell a true war story if it embarrasses you. if you don't care for obscenity, you don't care for the truth; if you don't care for the truth, watch how you vote. send guys to war, they come home talking dirty.  i felt most emotionally connected when tim o'brien was discussing his own ethical dilemma of heading to canada or head to war.  men killed, and died, because they were embarrassed not to. it was what had brought them to the war in the first place, nothing positive, no dreams of glory or honor, just to avoid the blush of dishonor. they died so as not to die of embarrassment.  in addition to the story , audible asked tim o'brien to read his new york times piece, \"the vietnam in me\" written in 1994 a few years after the gulf war. in it, tim o'brien is critical of some of the events in vietnam that are overlooked by american society and their history textbooks. evil has no place, it seems, in our national mythology. we erase it. we use ellipses. we salute ourselves and take pride in america the white knight, america the lone ranger, america's sleek laser-guided weaponry beating up on saddam and his legion of devils i would highly recommend the audible with bryan cranston. he was an excellent narrator.    \n",

                                                 drove out to manhattan last week to speak with my editor about a new novel (more on that soon). the trip is a rough seven hours east on i-80 and there was a lot of time to burn. i made some use of it by downloading a couple audio books over at audible, the company that did a sweet job on the man from primrose lane.i brought two books along with me. the first was defending jacob, which was a murder mystery that came highly recommended. it was well written and well told. but in the end, little more than grief porn and parental paranoia. not my thing. the other story, though, was a classic: the turn of the screw, published in 1898. and its mood and tone fit perfectly well with the new england autumn backdrop.the yarn begins the way so many good old stories do, with a character coming forth to explain why this story he’s about to tell you is the most depraved, most frightening thing you’ve ever heard. lovecraft does this a lot, this circus barking to ramp up suspense. we’ve somehow lost this over the last hundred years, with most editors and writers preferring to just get us right into the story as if they’re embarrassed to sell it too much. which is a shame, because it really does add a keen sense of suspicion.simple story, well done. a young woman applies to become the governess of two children who live on a country estate. the last governess died under mysterious circumstances and may be haunting the place. that’s about it. but the execution is lyrical, wonderful. james slowly turns the screw until the sense of dread about bly manor is palpable. and he’s daring enough to leave any real explanation to the reader. is the woman going crazy? or are the ghosts real? oh, and it packs a hell of a wallop in one last sentence.if you pick up a copy, put in on the shelf between jane eyre and rebecca. but i recommend going the audible route and heading out for a long road trip. somewhere desolate and cold.   \n",

3-14-56. paroled: 7-6-59.as i write this review, i'm sitting about 60 miles from the clutter house in holcomb, kansas. holcomb is a small, farming community located just west of garden city. this is a place where everyone in the whole county not only knows your name, but also has a working knowledge of your family history going back fifty plus years. i usually avoid reading true crime books. i don't want my head filled with tragedy. i want to go about my life with a degree of caution, but not be ruled by the fear i feel such books will instill. i picked up a copy of this book at the dodge city library. the librarian at the check out desk, a woman about mid-sixties, slender, elegant, and still attractive ran her finger along the edge of the spine. i noticed a shiver had rolled up her back and rippled her shoulders. she looked up at me with pinched blue eyes and said in a whisper, \"i remember when this happened\". she watched her father put locks on the doors for the first time. the murders became a demarcation line in her life there was life before the clutter murders, and then there was life after the clutter murders. her response surprised me. we live in a time when any crime anywhere in the country is broadcast out to the nation and something tragic that happens in illinois or in virginia or alaska impacts our lives. i would have thought over time some of the significance of the clutter murder would have been buried under the avalanche of murder and mayhem that the news cycle brings us 24/7. for this community and for all the small communities dotting the map of kansas, and even in the surrounding states, this was something that wasn't supposed to happen in a small town. this was big city crime that happened in their own backyard. as i talked to people about the clutter murders most everybody had some kind of physical reaction. they flinched as if they were dodging a blow or took a step back from me or developed a twitch along their jawline. their eyes gazed through me or beyond me as the fears and anxieties of 1959 came flooding back into their mind. most of them attributed more deaths to the crime, each of them citing six deaths rather than four. i'm sure they remembered that there was six family members, but two older girls had already left the home to start their own lives. they were not present on that fateful night when their family was murdered. in cold blood was required reading in many schools in this region clear up until about the 1970s, so even people who were too young to remember the crime have experienced the tragedy through truman capote. in the description above regarding perry edward smith there is a reference to phillips county. this has special significance for me because i was born and raised in phillips county. the family farm is located in phillips county. my father and i graduated from phillipsburg high school. my dad was a sophomore in high school in 1955 when perry smith decided to burglarize the chandler sales company in phillipsburg, kansas and this seemingly insignificant act was really the beginning of this story. smith and his accomplice, also smith, stole typewriters, adding machines etc and left town with their ill gotten goods in the backseat of the car. later they ignored a traffic signal in st. joseph, missouri and were pulled over by a police officer. the cop was very interested in what was in their backseat. they were extradited back to phillipsburg, where through an open window (image my embarrassment for the law enforcement of my home county) they escaped. later perry was caught again and sent back to phillipsburg where the law enforcement fortunately did a much better job of keeping track of him. perry smith received 10 years in the kansas penitentiary in leavenworth. richard eugene hickock was already serving time in leavenworth for fraud. the two met and became friends. the final piece to the puzzle that not only determined the fate of the clutter family, but also the fates of smith and hickock was snapped down in place when they meet floyd wells. wells, serving time for some bit of stupidity, had worked for herb clutter back in 1948. he told hickock and smith that clutter was a wealthy farmer, and kept a safe full of cash in his house. wells was absolutely full of shit. there was no safe. there was no pile of cash. there was absolutely no reason for four people to lose their lives for $40. \\n\\nafter the murders they went to mexico for a while, but even though they could live cheaply down south the money still trickled through their fingers. after they burned through the goods they had acquired through the clutter robbery and through defrauding a series of retail stores, they found that working in mexico didn't pay well either. they came back up to the united states and there was this baffling moment where perry smith is reading the paper and sees an article about a family that was tied up and shot to death. \"amazing!\" perry glanced through the article again. \"know what i wouldn't be surprised? if this wasn't done by a lunatic. some nut that read about what happened out in kansas.\" wtf? some nut? how about the original coconut heads that murdered the family in kansas? perry does have a moment or two where he weighs what happened in kansas. \"know what i think?\" said perry. \"i think there must be something wrong with us. to do what we did.\"\"did what?\"\"out there.\"\"deal me out, baby,\" dick said. \"i'm a normal.\"truman capote had been looking for the right story for an experimental form of writing he'd been considering trying. he wanted to blend fiction and nonfiction. the clutter murders struck him as the perfect story to launch this new form of writing. i have to admire his fortitude, for a man of his sensibilities not only spending that much time among farmbillies, but having to befriend them as well. it must have been somewhat of a painful experience. \\n\\ncapote in the clutter homefloyd wells eventually comes forward and tells what he knows about the murders. he had always liked herb clutter and felt ashamed that what he had told, in a moment of prison bonding, had led to such a vicious conclusion. without his statement i'm pretty sure that smith and hickock would have gotten away with the murders. the slender evidence tying them to the murders would have made it almost impossible to prosecute them. their sentencing can have only one conclusion...death. as they are being led back to their cells:smith says to hickock, \"no chicken-hearted jurors, they!\" they both laughed loudly, and a cameraman photographed them. the picture appeared in a kansas paper above a caption entitled: \"the last laugh?\"when i consider their bravado the last vestiges of any sympathy i may have been harboring for their plight dissipated. this is a beautifully written book. i want to thank harper lee for her role in helping capote bring this book to completion. i'm not sure capote would have had the perseverance to see it through without her holding his hand. i was surprised about how many connections i have to the events in this book many of which i had no idea until i read them in the book for the first time. i was long overdue to read this book and this experience has certainly convinced me to add more of the classic true crime genre to my reading queue. this book is legendary not only because of the heinous nature of the crime, but also because capote was ushering in a new way to tell a story. if you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews,

classic children's tale deserves 5 stars for story craft and language usage alone! (read your strunk & white to understand this man's talents in that regard.) the fact that it's a heart-warmer/wrencher clinches it. never was i made to love pigs and spiders so much in my life. charlotte's web will always rank high amongst my favorites. but why, for the love of god, did they make us watch the cartoon version of this tear-jerker in school? did they want to make us weep embarrassingly in front of one another? if so, mission accomplished, you sadistic school district!   \n",

                                               about 30 pages into this book, i was struck with a moment of panic:what's going on here? where the hell is garfield?!?had the lasagna-loving feline been uncerimoniously behead on the guillotine before the happenings of page 1? without my favorite cartoon cat's wry, laid-back sense of wit these are surely the worst of times!that is when i realized i was reading the classic text a tale of two cities, by charles dickens and not watching the 2006 cinematic masterpiece garfield: a tail of two kitties! holy crap! how embarrassing!against my better judgement, i decided to keep reading, hoping that at some point garfield would pop up and say something hilarious about hating mondays. well, fellow readers, he doesn't. i repeat: garfield is not in this book! at all!instead, dickens (is that his real name? lol!) crafts a tale of sacrifice and redemption set against the bleak background of the french revolution. overall, i guess it's an okay book, if you're into the \"classics\" sort-of thing, but i believe in my heart of hearts that this novel really could've benefitted by at least a cameo from jon arbuckle or something.   \n",

brain matter compared with the heart?\"so states one of the last lines in this short, brilliant novel, a thought -provoking book, life is temporary after all. this phrase is about mr. richard dalloway who works for the government in the early 1920's in london, england. clarissa dalloway's nice, steady husband, rather ordinary, he will never be a member of the prestigious cabinet, nevertheless she loves him, he reciprocates that emotion...she knows, but he's much too embarrassed to verbalize , showing it by giving wonderful flowers, yet there is something missing in her existence, she has a great husband, a beautiful, dutiful daughter elizabeth 18, devoted to her father, a good home. she, while not pretty at 52, but attractive , gives glamorous, grand parties to her many friends and relatives, important people in society mostly. the movers and shakers in the nation, the perfect hostess, elegant, calm, sophisticated, always says the right thing to others, still she feels bored, needing excitement. clarissa's mind constantly wanders, thinking and pondering, has she chosen the right path. the happy memories of the past, thirty years ago...of the frightening peter her first love, wild sally seton, the best friend clarissa ever had, so fearless, outrageous and amusing, everyone liked, peter walsh is coming back from india, a man she could have married, nothing dull about him, an unstable but always vibrant, her former lover, will be at the party ( not very successful), rich sally also, mrs . dalloway is uneasy. the narrative of the book takes place in just one day, the ubiquitous giant big ben clock, sounds the alarm, striking often, every hour, and more, as time flows by reminding her not only the party is near but life is limited, should not waste it, in idle dreams, live in the present, be content, this crazy, unpredictable, cold world...will not continue forever, not last. virginia woolf's most popular novel, still has dark aspects, the trying to forget , not possible...set a few years after the end of hostilities. a classic, from another era.vast sufferings of world war 1 soldiers, is vaguely mentioned ( except for one character), the english

       "78372   of life and death, verbs and nounsi expected this novel to be difficult. however, it wasn't difficult at all. it was an enormous pleasure.i was struck by the preponderance of \\nverbs\\n. the novel might happen in the head of clarissa dalloway or the other characters, but they are observing activity and their thoughts reflect it.it is more dynamic than passive or self-conscious or self-reflective.it was less a stream of consciousness, than a consciousness of life as a stream or a number of streams, rolling and tumbling and flowing in the direction of some great expanse, the ocean, an ocean of possibilities, perhaps even a party.the word \"life\" is a noun, but in my opinion, the life we live is a bundle of verbs. life is the vitality and vibrancy of the verbs we inject into it. life is what you \"do\" during the course of your time on earth. all the large and little things you do. life is eros, a life force, which can be juxtaposed in freudian terms with death (the absence of life) or thanatos.perhaps clarissa dalloway represents the vitality of eros, while her \"double\", septimus, represents thanatos.whatever, the two coexist in the novel and in each of us.how our lives turn out depends on how we accommodate their coexistence.we can let them fight or allow them to dance.\"a dance to the music of time\"ultimately, virginia woolf's novel felt to me like a dance, a progressive waltz, perhaps between life and death, eros and thanatos.it seemed to be even more worthy of the description \"a dance to the music of time\" than anthony powell's work.here is a description of the poussin painting of that name from the first novel in the sequence, \"a question of upbringing\", part of which could apply to \"mrs dalloway\":\"these classical projections, and something from the fire, suddenly suggested poussin's scene in which the seasons, hand in hand and facing outward, tread in rhythm to the notes of the lyre that the winged and naked greybeard plays. \"the image of time brought thoughts of mortality: of human beings, facing outward like the seasons, moving hand in hand in intricate measure, stepping slowly, methodically sometimes a trifle awkwardly, in evolutions that take recognisable shape: or breaking into seemingly meaningless gyrations, while partners disappear only to reappear again, once more giving pattern to the spectacle: unable to control the melody, unable, perhaps, to control the steps of the dance.\"i started to gyrate as i read on, then unable to control the melody, unable to control the steps of the dance, i grew dizzy, and slowly i started to remember something that happened a long, long time ago...the call of dutyeach long table in the dining room seated 20 people, ten aside facing each other, as you'd expect, just like the year before, only now there would be some faces gone and some new faces expected, you wouldn’t really know who until everybody had returned from the end of term vacation and taken their position, some sitting in the same place, some moving to fill the gaps, some leaving a space to be filled by someone new.there were a dozen or so at their usual table by the time ian arrived for dinner, he looked up and down the table, until he saw six familiar faces, a hint of recognition on his face, his friends were all towards one end of the table, away from the front doors, although nobody occupied the two end seats, they had been left for latecomers.to the left of his friends, a group of first year students were sitting in the middle of the table, not yet known or identified by names, so ian pulled out a seat at the end of the table and prepared to sit down, gently lifting his chair so as not to make a sound and disturb the conversation that was in progress, chatter, chatter, talk, talk, this is what i did on my holidays, keith had obtained work as a legal clerk, ginny had spent the whole time at her parents’ beach house on the south coast, becky had returned to switzerland and worked in a strawberry jam factory, making tiny woodchips that were supposed to replace the seeds that dissolved in the acidic process of making the jam.an olive, almost dark, complexioned woman walked up and asked if she could sit on the chair opposite ian, he nodded yes, not knowing who she was or whether she already knew his friends, she had not been in college last year, while everybody else reacted enthusiastically, yes, sure, of course, thanks for joining us, judy, becky said, have you met everybody here, this is ian, she said, i’ve heard so much about this ian, judy replied with a smile, in her eastern european accent, he couldn’t work out where it was from, though it was not as guttural as german, he stood and shook judy’s hand, almost chivalrously, although there was no need for chivalry yet, at least, nothing to be chivalrous about, these days, apart of course from the presence of this charming woman, which was more than enough, but ian was already smiling, he liked this new judy.she answered ian’s many eager questions politely, until finally he had ascertained that she was hungarian, and that her father was the hungarian ambassador, from communist hungary, as it was then, she was moving into college for her second last year while she worked on her honours thesis in french literature and wanted to be closer to the french department and away from the temptations of diplomatic parties and constant socializing, as if college life would be any less demanding, even though she loved that life, she was diligent in her studies, she wanted to be a writer, a publisher or a diplomat herself, and ian had found all of this out while he deftly worked away at his roast lamb and three vegetables, it was a sunday night before the first day of the new term, and there was always a roast of some sort.some of their friends finished their meals and left during the conversation, though ian continually brought the chit chat back to judy, as if they were the only ones present, you could tell he was infatuated already, well, becky could, she was more alert to these things, her father was the australian ambassador to switzerland, it wasn’t a big deal, switzerland was only a small country anyway, it wasn’t even discussed amongst their friends, but they had nevertheless gravitated towards each other, informally forming a group of diplomatic children, ian being the odd one out, the son of a banker, though his ambition was to be a diplomat, and if unsuccessful in that ambition, to at least get a few foreign affairs under his belt, he had a taste for the exotic, almost as if he was seeking a life raft upon which to escape from the routine life that awaited him in australia in those days.judy was the first one of the remaining group to rise from the table, but as she did so, she reached into her handbag and took out four small envelopes, they contained invitations, each of them inscribed with someone’s name in neat blue fountain pen, though not the script that was familiar to australians at the time, even her writing was exotic, she gave three to ian’s remaining friends, and then, looking ian in the eyes, handed him one, too, i would be delighted if you would come to my room for drinks on tuesday night, any time between 8 and 11, ian looked at the envelope and saw that it already bore his name, ian graye, he still has that envelope somewhere, with his other love letters and curios, judy said, i knew i would meet you sooner or later, so i took the liberty of making out an invitation for you, what if you hadn’t liked me, he asked, well, in that case, i would have wasted an envelope and some writing paper, she said, not a great loss, but i didn’t think there was much chance of that.no sooner were the envelopes circulated than judy left to return to her room, ian rising almost immediately afterwards, looking at his watch and saying, well, duty calls, becky spotted the glint in his eye and laughed, you mean, judy calls, and she laughed again, as if she had just read his fortune in a teacup.the next two days, ian didn’t see judy or becky or keith or virginia, because other friends saw him enter the dining room and asked him to join them, each time introducing him to first year students that they had just met, so tuesday night came around quickly, although first he had to have some drinks in the union bar with some other students from his political science class, he had intended to finish up around 10pm and return to college for the last hour of the party, but it was 10:30 when he looked at his watch and realised he was going to be late, it was totally dark when he got outside, there was no moon and the stars were obscured by clouds, he walked quickly, anxiously, embarrassed, the crushed granite surface of the footpath crunching underfoot, his heart started to beat faster and a droplet of sweat formed on his temple, he was almost out of breath by the time he arrived at judy’s door, giving the impression that he had hurried to be there, even though he was close to three hours late and had nearly, rudely, missed the party altogether, still as judy was farewelling some of her other guests, she greeted ian with a kiss on either cheek in the european fashion, and he wished that it had been his lips, i didn’t think you were going to attend my party, she said, half reproachful, half delighted that he had actually turned up, he said, there was no way i would have missed it, i’m sorry that another duty called, she poured him a glass of bulls blood, egri bikaver, and sat him on the chair next to her writing desk, by this time they were the only ones left in the room, and she sat on her bed, from this time on, she said, i expect to be your first duty, ian placed his glass on the desk, having had only one sip, not that it was his first and only drink of the night, and he went and sat on the bed next to her and, perhaps too boldly, he

(p 23)and did they ever really communicate, or is this a marriage, if not of convenience, of expectation? an upwardly mobile politician with good prospects; he seemed like the right choice at the time. but, here is peter: the one that got away. clarissa simultaneously regrets and rationalizes her decision to let him go. he is flighty, lacks a seriousness of purpose, a scholar and writer who hasn’t lived up to his potential, has botched one marriage and is now involved in a second complicated entanglement that doesn’t bode well and to which he is not committed (all because he can’t let go of clarissa). and now, he’s back in london and hoping richard can arrange a job for him. each of these characters – clarissa, richard, peter – is having a mid-life crisis like any self-respecting baby boomer does. each — and their country! — is at a cross-roads. the times they are a-changin’, but before they do, there’s an anxious, stagnant vacuum in the zeitgeist that none of them, no matter how clever their rationalizations, light-hearted their chatter, or perfect their party, can fill.peter and clarissa are two sides of the same coin; she would have been him had she not married well. he is her past (and she is his): romanticized, on the brink of seemingly infinite possibilities at the time, but gone. it is her past she mourns, the self she should have become; and her present — the self she did become — she struggles to make sense of. the time she thought she had to become who she thought she would be has passed. she can’t fully admit this, because to do so would mean acknowledging the emptiness and meaninglessness of her life. so instead, she throws parties. every flight of fancy, every enthusiasm and exuberance in which she professes to love life, is surrounded by death or some kind of emptiness. i perceive clarissa’s adamant insistence that life is wonderful and her manic frenzied outbursts as overcompensation for her true state of mind and her intuition, which she skitters around and never raises to full consciousness, that her life is, rather, one of emptiness and isolation. and let’s talk about richard, clarissa’s slightly shadowy husband. yet another character who’s come to a certain age and is facing the realization that this is as far as he’ll go, this is it. a practical man, though: he doesn’t appear to think too much about it, but rather accepts his lot and gets on with it. only through other lenses (clarissa’s, peter’s, lady bruton’s) do we see him clearly.but that is true of all of them, isn’t it? and this is woolf’s genius. the chatter, the gossip, the endless speculation and self-examinations never penetrate the real meaning of things. they, and particularly clarissa, see, think, feel but do they ever truly understand? certainly not their own characters, and only partially those of others. and how well do they interpret? are they even accurate reporters? my sense is no. not only do they misinterpret, but they see only the surface.(there is an interesting commentary here on consciousness and especially the subconscious. for her thorough, and no doubt justified dislike of psychiatry, woolf must have known of freud and jung; she is exploring consciousness and unconscious motives here — especially clarissa’s.)woolf is saying that none of us ever see the truth of our own situations, and also that we can’t know the truth about others’. we see, feel, experience and interpret the world through our own lens—one lens—and we are seen, felt, experienced and interpreted by other individuals through theirs. only in the aggregate, by putting them all together and triangulating them, can we get a glimpse of the real meaning (in this case, the reader becomes the omniscient one). meaning is a slippery changeling; at any moment, it can slip away in the same way, perhaps, as one’s reason can.and now to septimus: why does woolf give us septimus? in addition to being a commentary on the tragic state of psychiatry, the ignorance around mental illness of the time (which of course woolf knew all too well), the folly of the cures and the hypocritical and harmful “healers,” septimus is the classic foil: he shows us insanity (oh, and how well does woolf write it!) so that we can recognize how fragile sanity is; how much a matter of perception, how relative it is, and how thin the line between reason and lack of it. he is also death, in contrast to clarissa’s life.  i cannot help but feel that all of these characters — including septimus — are different aspects of one larger character. they exist as a kind of ‘collective unconscious’ and, in that, are emblematic of their society. for the entire country is in transition, and that topic threads through the text: what is britain to do about india; and what is to become of the stodgy old lords and ladies, dangerously, bumblingly incompetent but still in power? the old must give way to the new, both in personal and political life. the war, like clarissa’s influenza, may be over, but what’s left is a country and a way of life that is dead. even though woolf doesn’t show us, directly, any agents of change within mrs dalloway, she does show us a world, and the people in it, who will be casualties of it.**************************************i reserve the right to alter or even completely delete and rewrite this review as conversation ensues in virginia woolf's library!!

to an adult, they're only vignettes, synopses typed out in large set. \"sized for small hands,\" the back of each book reads, \"this high quality, hardcover book is a valuable addition to every child's library.\"half of my little unicorn collection is in very nice condition, but on peter pan, twenty thousand leagues, and antique fairy tales, the laminate is blistering and, in pan's case, peeling away from the book cover.both the unicorn and little unicorn editions of peter pan were illustrated by greg hildebrandt. like the other full-size unicorn books, this particular hardcover volume is clothbound in bright green fabric. it's a bold emerald color, brighter than unicorn's a christmas carol forest-green fabric (also illustrated by hildebrandt, a variation on his original 1983 simon and schuster illustrations). peter pan's green cover seems especially stark next to the stodgier brown and maroon of, respectively, the covers of pinocchio and robin hood (both illustrated, also, by hildebrandt).i used to very carefully examine peter pan's illustrations during church--the little unicorn edition could be hidden, somewhat, in the cleavage of a thick open bible. in the years since, i have actively hated every other illustrated version of peter pan. my complaints are legion: the pan is a freckle-faced child with zero sex appeal; he is a devil-faced disney imp; he is obviously based on mary martin. he is always too young or too old, too victorian or too modern. some illustrator always forgets his titular pan-pipes, strung on a lace about his neck.of course, as barrie reminds us, the topography of neverland itself is the literal depiction of a child's mind, a dynamic dream. so no illustrator can get it quite right.this brings me to a strange admission: when i was a kid, i took the little unicorn edition of peter pan to school, where i insisted to classmates that the paintings inside were not only portraits of real people, but in fact, painted from actual photographs taken inside neverland. it was only a game, but i was very convincing: i insisted, as if it were really really really true.i'm not sure why i admitted this to my best childhood friend today. i was embarrassed when i told her. i described what seems now a blithely malicious act.\"did anyone fall for it?\" she wanted to know. she'd just given me the unabridged unicorn edition of peter pan, today, an unexpected gift.\"one person did,\" i nodded.\"i might have, too,\" she said. \"i was really gullible.\"but in retrospect, hildebrandt's paintings for pinocchio and the others have aged better than peter pan's illustrations. the others are, each in its own way, period pieces; the victorian and renaissance eras are all muddled browns and stiff staging.peter pan, though, is a different creature. its anti-hero is a dimpled preteen boy with strong, brown arms, feathered brown hair, and a leafy diaper. tinker bell, with her wild shock of platinum hair, is a leggy strumpet; her toes are always pointed like a ballerina. tiger lily, the brave piccaninnie princess, is a long, lean woman in a leather bikini top (incidentally, her portraits are based on one heidi corso, who was at that time unicorn publishing's associate editor).the illustrations that captivated me most in the 80s are the ones that, in 2009, seem most dated. in the fifth plate, \"the magic shores of neverland,\" peter and the children are airborne, and peter gestures down toward the islands below that, in the pink fire of morning, look pastel-purpley. without the victorian children in their nightgowns, the scene could be the backdrop for one of those realistic fantasy paintings of dolphins, the kind you used to find on a trapper keeper.in plate 16, \"the mermaids' lagoon,\" the women, swatting at bubbles, all wear long, wild hair: red, blonde, blue, purple. their lavender fish scales glint gold in the light, a painterly suggestion of iridescence, a photorealistic lisa frank visage.now, as an adult, my favorite images are muted browns, impervious to the passage of time. they usually involve the story's central and most villainous grown-up, captain hook. in the plate \"the elegant captain hook,\" wendy takes hold of the pirate's enormous hook as he escorts her out of her house. this painting is confusing because hook is, in actuality, kidnapping wendy. but he is charmed when he sees wendy for the first time, and in spite of his nefarious intentions, he extends his hook toward her. she is equally startled, and in spite of her understandable terror, she accepts, her tiny hand wrapping around the cold black metal.in an earlier plate, hildebrandt's \"the arch-enemies meet,\" hook faces peter, and there is some sort of brown grey granite between them. peter is grinning sadistically, while captain hook appears to be gnashing his teeth. the painting is, by any child's measure of aesthetics, completely uninteresting.here is what is happening, though, if memory serves: hook and peter are in a stand-off of sorts, and at the same time, both are trying to keep hold of the same slippery rock in the sea. for peter, this is just a game. but when hook begins to slip off the rock, peter grabs hold of his arm, hoisting hook back up to his level. in that moment of vulnerability, the pirate plunges his enormous hook the fleshy space between peter's rib and hip.what follows is what matters: peter is horrified. more importantly, hook has broken his heart. hook means murder. he is that abomination of real life: he is a grown person who would willingly hurt a child.what peter doesn't realize, though, is that this all has happened before. each time the two face off, hook plunges his missing hand into peter's side, and each time, peter's heart is broken anew. hook remembers all of this, certainly, but peter is condemned to repeat this scene's action again and again. because, if a child were never to grow up, it means he'd never make new memories. peter's innocence relies entirely on his inability to learn from experience.what so few illustrators are able to emphasize is that peter pan, the book, is a victorian horror story, with peter cast as the story's real monster. his anger lasts only a moment; his childlike love lacks depth or meaning. even in spite of her best, tinker bell--too small, someone explains, to hold more than one pure feeling inside of her at once--tries to have wendy killed.small surprise, then, that peter is too undisciplined to return for wendy in the coming years, or he simply doesn't care enough. when he does come to her window to take her away, she has to explain, in the dark, that she can't accompany him anymore. then wendy suddenly stands to turn on the light. and although barrie assures us, in a writerly flittering, that wendy did bloom into a beautiful, tall young woman, the vocabulary here is distinctly that of horror. peter recoils as wendy's terrible, grown form rises from its chair, and he screams out when the light comes on, when he sees how changed she is.his sense of loss is fleeting, however, because he immediately turns his attention to wendy's daughter. wendy tries to stop him, but he has already taken her.plate 30 is the last plate in the book. it is titled \"when wendy grew up,\" and it is black and white and grey, a pencil drawing. in it, wendy stares out the window after her own daughter, and at peter, whose silhouettes have rapidly narrowed into tiny moonlit sylphs. both have already forgotten her.it's a complicated picture to abandon a child with, because it is a very muted picture. it is essentially a pencil drawing of aching.hildebrandt--that painter of glimmering wings and floating pastel bubbles--bravely disappoints children with the final plate. it's the most important, though, so apt a rendering is it of the grown-up melancholy that besets those childlike flourishes of grief. the emotion is complicated and ponderous, too large for any tinker bell to contain. i assume that it's the sort of illustration mr. barrie, the author, himself intended.the plate accompanies this text, which in turn concludes the novel:\"of course in the end wendy let them fly away together. our last glimpse of her shows her at the window, watching them receding into the sky until they were as small as stars.\"as you look at wendy you may see her hair becoming white, and her figure little again, for all this happened long ago. jane is now a common grown-up, with a daughter called margaret; and every spring-cleaning time, except when he forgets, peter comes for margaret and takes her to the neverland, where she tells him stories about himself, to which he listens eagerly.\"when margaret grows up she will have a daughter, who is to be peter's mother in turn; and so it will go on, so long as children are gay and innocent and heartless.\"   \n",

gripped by this story. thought it was written in the 1950's, that just washes away, becomes trivial. the story is about a man surviving against all odds. just a factory worker, he struggles with his humanity and becomes a scientist and a scholar--he elevates himself. so many parts of this book held me in thrall, but the section about the dog brought tears to my eyes. even the science, though rooted in early concepts of bacteriology, still rings as plausible. this was a masterfully written tale and ended perfectly. it is, in my mind, the standard by which zombie and vampire books should be held. don't even compare the movies--they are just bastardizations of this brilliant work. all my thumbs up. a must-read! visceral, compelling...this story will stay with you.   \n",

was familiar with other works by john steinbeck, but somehow i hadn't gotten around to this classic of american literature until now.pardon my language, but holy shit is this book good. i was blown away by the scope of the work, how it followed not just the joad family traveling from oklahoma to california, but it also meditated on the problems of all the displaced families of the great depression, and on all the poor farmers who were driven from their homes and their lands by big banks and greedy corporations. many of those farmers ended up in california, hoping to find work and a decent living, but instead found menial wages, prejudice, hunger and disease. it's a devastating chapter of american history.i listened to this on audio, read by the talented actor dylan baker, and i would highly recommend his performance. i also recommend the 1940 film version directed by john ford and starring henry fonda, which was mostly faithful to the book. in the movie, fonda seems to be carrying the entire weight of the depression on his shoulders.i think what is most alarming about reading the grapes of wrath in the early 21st century is recognizing how relevant the themes are today, because the country is still run by big banks and greedy corporations. karl marx was right: the working class is oppressed, y'all.five stars for the impressive john steinbeck. five stars for the joad family, searching for a new life. and five stars for dylan baker's excellent narration.favorite quotes\"there ain't no sin and there ain't no virtue. there's just stuff people do.\"\"and the

                                    far cleverer people than me have reviewed and critiqued this book, with far more intelligence and insight into political theory than i could ever have. so i’m not going to embarrass myself by even trying. instead, i’m just going to give a general overview of what i thought about my book. those who are looking for an intense academic conversation, probably better to look at other reviews. apologies. :)well then, the review. personally, it was really interesting for me to know that the book was dedicated to lorenzo de’ medici. as an amateur school-level historian i’ve taken an immense amount of interest the medici as historical figures, so it was amazing for me to read something that it’s quite possible one of them may have read. of course, it’s equally possible that he didn’t, but even were that the case, it was still fascinating to read such a renowned book, from such a renowned author, written during my favourite period of history – the renaissance.a lot of people have probably described machiavelli and his work the prince as “evil”. and you can probably see why, after you’ve read it, and especially considering that people like hitler claim to have studied the prince. but i read it, and i turned out okay. i think…for a long time now i’ve been hearing the word “machiavellian”… people spitting out the word as if it’s supposed to be a bad thing, or pulling it out of the ether with a slightly superior air, as if to say “well yes, i know all about machiavellian, i’ve read the prince.” needless to say, part of my reading the prince was to be able to lay claim to that same superiority, even if i never have the nerve to use it. but the other reason was that i had no idea what people were talking about. they said he was cunning, and really i couldn’t see that as such a bad thing. from the small amount that i knew of machiavelli, i just could not understand why on earth you’d want to stay away from being identified with him, and now i know why.it’s not because machiavelli is immoral, not at all. no, it’s because machiavelli almost completely ignores ethics in light of attempting to achieve his goal – recommending the best ways for princes to stay in power. and, bloody hell, you just can’t argue with the bastard. his method of argument was something i found both fascinating and scary. fascinating because it’s all logical and faultless, and he uses many classic examples to show the reader how different famous military leaders went wrong. and to be honest, it’s not like machiavelli is standing there prancing up and down going; “hey! people! come on, it’s fun to be a crafty immoral bastard who kills loads of people.” he’s just being matter-of-fact, rather saying; “hey, well, you said you wanted to be a prince. sorry, dude, but sometimes that means killing people who annoy you. or rather, people who need to die so you can stay where you want to be. so, yeah, people who annoy you.” sometimes in fact he essentially encourages ethics and morals, acknowledging the fact that if you’re an evil bastard all the time you are never going to get anywhere, because no-one at all will like you. you’ve just got to learn how to be morally correct and nice to the right people. so, no, machiavelli was not completely immoral. but i think what scares people is his utter lack of recognition of people as human beings. and what if people get in the way of your ultimate goal? well, that’s just too bad for them. and it truly was chilling, sometimes; to read the almost careless, cold way that machiavelli talks of people.that was pretty much my overall idea of the prince. it’s a fascinating book for anyone interested in political history, and for anyone who has ever heard of the infamous machiavelli. besides that it’s incredibly interesting for anyone who, does, well, want to take over the world. good luck with that, guys. if my judgement is any indication, you’ll need this book. you’ll never get anywhere without it.   \n",
       "83342   jane austen's detractors always attack the whole premise of her aesthetic: its circumscription. the anti-janeites, from romantics like charlotte brontë and ralph waldo emerson to marxists like raymond williams and edward said, are forever complaining that she leaves too much out—the natural world, the spiritual world, the human body, the napoleonic wars, the capitalist system, the british empire. as virginia woolf writes in her common reader essay on austen:she knew exactly what her powers were, and what material they were fitted to deal with as material should be dealt with by a writer whose standard of finality was high. there were impressions that lay outside her province; emotions that by no stretch or artifice could be properly coated and covered by her own resources.novelist carol shields observes that austen's aesthetic minimalism and ideological idealism are so rigorous that there are no fingers and toes in her fiction—and just as austen's relative silence about slavery is redacted by patricia rozema's 1999 mansfield park film, so joe wright corrects her digital deficit in his 2005 pride and prejudice adaptation, whose lizzy bennet goes barefoot almost enough to satisfy quentin tarantino—and that's without mentioning the porcine testicles wright notoriously also includes in the film, which is perhaps not what charlotte brontë meant when she criticized the lack of \"open country\" in austen.while our flaubert-and-hemingway-conditioned contemporary mfa idea of \"the literary\" is saturated in very non-austenian physical concreteness, as one computational humanist reveals, jane austen is otherwise our ancestor in her political silences. our novels may have fingers galore, but still not too many napoleons. when madeline ffitch complains in this vein about \"neoliberal realism\" (\"[m]arked by formal unity, the quest for authenticity, and the belief that the self is a 'bottomless pool' full of cogent meaning and redemption\"), she could be describing the flexibly conservative national agenda of austen's regency-era domestic novels just as well.realistic literary fiction after austen still tends to command an inside perspective on the world, where inside refers both to the cultural interiors of the (broadly) middle-class household and to the psychic interiors of its personae. austen invented the modern realist novel, and nowhere more than in emma, because she innovates upon 18th-century realism's cumbersome epistolary structures or mock-epic storytellers by introducing a subtle, supple, impersonal third-person narrator that spends half its time in its heroines' heads.the fiction-writing device that externalizes this interior life is free indirect discourse: a third-person narrative rhetoric that blends with the inner language of the character whose viewpoint it takes up. unlike first-person narrative, free indirect discourse communicates what a character could or would never consciously say for herself, but unlike third-person objective narration, it insists on miming or dramatizing her inner life rather than merely reporting on it. because it limits information to what one character at a time can know—or even one character per novel if the viewpoint is limited to the protagonist, as it mostly is in emma—free indirect discourse is also useful for creating suspense, since readers must discover the secrets of the plot alongside the often blinkered protagonist. as adela pinch notes in the introduction to the oxford world classics edition of emma:austen makes voices stick in the mind through her use of free indirect discourse, which makes a character's voice seem indelible, capable of soaking into other beings. but she also uses the same technique for representing thought. her cultivation of this mode of representing her heroines' minds has made her novels crucial to the history of the english novel, markers of a moment when the novel as a literary genre perfects its inward turn, and begins to claim human psychology as its territory.in emma, austen exploits both the ideological and aesthetic potential of this narrative form beautifully. the eponymous heroine seems to have it all—at 21, she is \"handsome, clever, and rich,\" the opening sentence famously informs us—but what she lacks is an understanding of the social structure she inhabits and the people who share it with her. how better to tell such a tale of inner transformation than from the inside out?the plot begins with a transformation of emma's estate, hartfield, in the small but london-adjacent town of highbury. after the early death of emma's mother, she was partially reared by her governess, miss taylor. but miss taylor has married; now mrs. weston, she has moved to a nearby estate called randalls, leaving emma alone with her gentle, hypochondriacal father. for his part, mr. woodhouse disapproves of marriage because it breaks up families—and emma accordingly resolves not to wed, especially since she, unlike lizzy bennet or fanny price, has no economic imperative to do so.instead of seeking to get married herself, the bored emma wants to marry off others. at the beginning of the novel, she takes up the cause of harriet smith, a boarding-school orphan of uncertain parentage. she declares harriet's first suitor—a local farmer who works on the estate of emma's single brother-in-law, mr. knightley—to be, as a yeoman, too middling to catch her fancy, unlike the graceful gentry or the picturesque poor. despite the likelihood that harriet herself also lacks pedigree, emma encourages her to reject martin.emma tries to fix harriet up with the new vicar, mr. elton, who mistakes emma's attentions to him on behalf of harriet as indicating the rich young woman's own attraction. excited by the possibility of his marrying up into one of highbury's most prominent families, mr. elton proposes to emma during a carriage ride, and is insulted to learn that she'd thought him drawn to the obscure harriet.while emma is chastened by this blunder, which occupies the first third of the novel, she immediately falls into another. mr. weston's flashy son, frank churchill, who has been reared by the aristocratic family of his deceased mother, comes to town. emma, though not quite as attracted to him as the town thinks she should be, falls into a flirtation with the witty if vain young man (he goes all the way to london for a haircut)—a flirtation at the expense of the mysteriously reserved jane fairfax.jane is another orphan, niece to emma's friend miss bates, a prolix and shabby-genteel vicar's daughter. emma plainly envies the lower-born but equally beautiful and occasionally more accomplished jane, which motivates her confederacy with frank to gossip about and even humiliate the diffident young woman, even though jane, unlike emma, is condemned to serve out the rest of her days as a governess rather than as wealthy mistress of a distinguished family estate.i will let first-time readers discover how this central thread of the plot ravels itself out through the novel's last two-thirds, but suffice to say that emma has again mistaken both the motives of those around her and her own drives and desires. ruled by vanity and an overactive imagination rather than by reason, she neglects her twofold duty: 1. to treat the less fortunate, like jane and miss bates, with kindness and forbearance; 2. not to upset the social hierarchy of the rural gentry, as in her attempt to marry harriet to mr. elton, which only leaves everyone upset and embarrassed, and results in the creation of vain monstrosities like mr. elton's eventual wife, a conceited and tasteless parvenu who is the second half of the novel's mortifying comic relief.perhaps the best way not to interfere with highbury's hierarchy is for emma to marry within her own elite class. this is where her brother-in-law mr. knightley comes in. to contemporary readers, he is an unlikely beau for emma. he is an old family friend, 16 years her senior, and he has, he confides to her, \"'been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least.'\" he also lectures more than flirts with her (\"'i cannot see you acting wrong, without a remonstrance'\"), unlike the immediately appealing if callow frank churchill, though the novel validates knightley's lectures by having the plot always prove them factually and morally correct, in contrast to emma's constant misprisions. churchill might be emma's male doppelgänger (\"'i think there is a little likeness between us,'\" he says at the close), but for that very reason could never be her partner, even if austen did not seem to think his vivacity unseemly and effeminate in a man.and knightley is the master of nearby donwell abbey, and the magistrate and defender of the whole neighborhood, suddenly beset as it is in the novel's second half with \"gypsies\" and thieves. he is, moreover, one of the only men mr. woodhouse might consent to marrying his daughter. we might even say that mr. woodhouse's ineffectual and unmanly hypochondria necessitates that another man, a real man, step in and rule hartfield. if the novel begins with the loss to marriage of emma's surrogate mother, it ends with her gaining, through marriage, a new and improved father.as for emma, her problem is that she represents a new way of thinking in england: recklessly imaginative and heedless of old divisions and hierarchies. she is particularly concerned to transform the economic into the aesthetic, as we see when she is offended by the idea that money-and-class concerns could intrude on true love and its emotive, aesthetic regard for the inner quality of persons:[b]ut then, mr. knightley did not make due allowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives. mr. knightley saw no such passion, and of course thought nothing of its effects; but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest; and more than a reasonable, becoming degree of prudence, s...   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          emma is one of those classic novels that may not grab the reader immediately from the first sentence. in fact, it took me a while to figure out who many of the characters were, and i had to go back and find out how the characters were all related. at times i felt like i was figuring out a complex equation. but soon enough, i became interested in what appeared to be trivial conversations between the characters, namely emma and her father, but once again, like in many of jane austen’s novels, i realised that what appeared like a trivial conversation was a clever way of introducing different aspects of each character, and the added sarcasm always revealed how the author perhaps, felt about society at the time. after all, to understand where the author is coming from, we need to understand the era when the novels were written, and how people would fuss about things that may not seem as important now, in this case, the georgian period. the protagonist is emma, a young woman who is comfortably set in society, as she has quite a large fortune and she feels no need to ever get married. she lives with her father who rarely ventures off to places far away from highbury, and offers his opinion to anyone who does. he likes his comforts and believes everyone feels the same as he does. emma however, is more clever than he is — even if she irresponsibly takes it upon herself to play match-maker with her new friend, harriet, and others, we do see her contemplating things from other people’s perspectives many times. even though she thinks she is right in many matters, we do see her inwardly questioning some of her decisions.for the above reasons, i don’t think that emma is as obnoxious as we may assume when we are first introduced to the character. it is irresponsible of her to misguide harriet, especially when mr martin obviously loves harriet, and she too loves him deep down. emma convinces her that they are not a suitable match, and believes he is beneath her in society even if no-one knows who harriet’s parents are and mr martin is a lot more established than she is financially. however, emma does feel guilt at times, especially when mr knightley, her friend, questions her decisions, so we see that there is room for the character to show compassion and see things from someone else’s perspective. in contrast her father refuses to believe that the seaside can be good for one’s health and we see him arguing with the decision his daughter, isabella, and her husband had made to holiday at the seaside with their children on doctor’s orders. he is a character that although is portrayed as being kind and caring, is in fact obnoxious or extremely naive. we see emma trying to keep the peace on many occasions, and being embarrassed by her father’s remarks. emma can seem like an unlikely character for a jane austen novel, but it’s never so black and white; there are many layers to the character. i think in life all types of people should be given a chance to see what else they have to offer, and jane austen, i think, understood that — not every person is what they always appear to be. she demonstrates this in many of her novels, and i was, once again, amazed by the author’s ability to reveal so many human characteristics that ring true with people even in today’s setting. for example, emma’s dislike for one of the characters, jane fairfax. in one scene she emphasises that the more jane’s aunt boasted about jane, the more emma’s dislike towards jane grew, even if jane herself was reserved. i found myself nodding at many such examples. the novel slowly becomes more interesting when the character of frank churchill and jane are thrown in the mix. the novel then unravels and many revelations are revealed. it is rather long and it took me a while to read it, but that is due to the fact that i felt like i had to study every sentence, as the writing is so rich and insightful. i felt that i would miss something important in even the most seemingly trivial of conversations. in today’s world many don’t have the time to sit without interruptions and really savour each word and contemplate what it means. it emphasises how life has changed, and that the things that constituted excellent writing have changed immensely. i am sure that in today’s era if this novel was published, it would be labelled as an over-written rom com because our modern world doesn’t really invite us to sit down and think — really think — well, that’s what i think anyway.it was an extremely well-written, delightful and entertaining novel. even though it took me a while to get into the story, i wanted to keep reading and see how the characters evolve. i think jane austen was a woman ahead of her time and saw things about society that others refused to see or were too caught up in following its expectations to care.   \n",
       "83816   a conversation about jane austen between myself and a second party would usually go like this:\\nsecond party:  have you read any jane austen books?me: i read pride and prejudice and sense and sensibilitysecond party: aren't they awesome? which p&p movie did you like?me: the one with keira knightley. i like her and the actor who played mr. darcy.second party: i agree! so what other austen novels do you plan on reading? me: none, really. i, uh, don't really like her bookssecond party: why not?me:  *shrugs shoulders* just not my cup of tea, i guess.\\ni would like to disclose in this review once and for all that i could never consider myself a jane austen fan. i know that she's an amazing, influential classical female writer whose works have been adapted on screen and translated worldwide. i also always nod in amicable agreement whenever someone mentions her as their favorite author because i can acknowledge her contributions to literature as well as respect the fact that you enjoy her works. that being said, austen is simply not the kind of writer whom i can connect with. i tried finding a semblance of kinship in her works several times in the past with pride and sense, two novels which i hadn't finished for the first two times i read them, but i only did so by the third and fourth time respectively.simply put, i don't like jane austen's books even if she is an immensely celebrated writer. i find her prose often tedious even if she can compose passages with wit and humor. i think her characters are intolerable and the only redeeming quality i admire about her characterizations is that she obviously isn't afraid to make her protagonists unlikable and absurd which is where the source of her rich social comedy of manners sprout from.for the longest time i told myself i will never read another austen novel again but because i was so irrevocably smitten with the pemberly digital webseries \\n\\n    emma approved\\n  \\nwhich is the modernized adaptation of this novel, i decided to venture on, reassuring myself that perhaps third's time the charm. in a few inspired ways, it was.but in many other instances that's almost painful, it wasn't.emma  is supposed to be a story about 'youthful hubris and misconstrued romance' and with austen's signature dry humor and amusing observations and parody regarding the exhausting social graces during the era she is writing in, emma  more than fulfills that promising premise. the titular heroine emma woodhouse is beautiful, clever and rich but she's also conceited and proud; often overestimating her so-called \"matchmaking\" skills. she's only twenty-one and a privileged one at that who has a very high opinion of herself and how others should view her. in spite of these flaws, emma can be impressive particularly because of her streak of independence and ideas about a woman's agency which were considered queer and upsetting during her time. because she has no financial hardships unlike other austen heroines, emma does not feel obligated to get married.in fact, as an heiress, she would rather just live by herself in her estate and possibly throw cool parties and hang out with other legible ladies whom she can charm and bewitch. one of them who has fallen prey to emma's irresistible companionship is the modest harriet smith who eagerly tries to please emma by following every single advice the other woman gives even if ultimately it proves to be to her detriment. their friendship is not exactly of equals which make their interactions quite infectiously funny and warm at times. i have no doubt emma adores harriet but she tends to confuse that with her incessant need to control harriet's choices for her which had proved to be bothersome. emma's heart is in the right place but she's also far too headstrong to realize that her actions often cause harm or misunderstanding to the people around her. but austen has written the approach to this relationship as a little bit of a comedy so at least that breaks the tension a bit.the main conflict that happened in the first volume (this novel is divided into four, or whatever, i'm too lazy to check the book again) is emma's adamant belief that a certain mr. elton fancies her friend harriet. emma was so convinced that she is doing something remarkable and worthwhile by matchmaking these two that she was totally blind-sighted by the fact that mr. elton actually wants emma and not harriet. it was only when mr. elton himself confessed that emma realized that she was wrong to make assumptions from evidence that she willfully and purposefully interpreted for her own convenience and in support of her own twisted logic. not only did she embarrass and humiliate harriet and mr. elton by placing them in a very awkward position concerning misread signals and feelings, she has also deliberately cast aside harriet's suitor robert who seemed to like harriet enough and sincerely wanted to be a good husband to her, if she will have him. to emma, however, harriet should aspire for more. not a bad sentiment; in fact it's the kind of liberal thinking ahead of her time--but it's not something accepted by society back then so poor harriet will only suffer humiliation to her character, all because emma wants to put her in equal footing as herself which is ridiculous! harriet is nice and sweet but she can't have the same set of choices and freedom as emma because emma has the privilege to be fickle, vain and independent--harriet simply does not. emma's ignorance over such an obvious difference between their social standing is irritating--yet also very endearing.emma being emmaemma does not care that people in her social circle would see harriet as beneath them; she adores harriet nevertheless because she finds her interesting and special and whether or not she realizes it can be a tad condescending is unimportant because emma only has good intentions even if those intentions get her into troubles of her own silly making. i think emma is very well-written, filled with enough flaws and entitlement that give her much depth as the protagonist. another aspect of her character that i had fun exploring was when it comes to her opinions and insights regarding the lovely jane fairfax. emma is insecure around jane, mostly because jane is reserved and hard to engage in small talk, as well as the very definition of an accomplished woman that emma aspires to be. while emma is merely content indulging on her whims for so-called self-improvement and autonomy outside marriage, jane fairfax dedicates herself to fulfilling work outside the confines of her social class which makes her more learned, resourceful and educated about the world. the only thing that emma comforts herself with when it comes to jane fairfax is that jane is actually pretty dull in personality, often the subject of light mockery between emma and the slightly douche-y frank churchill. in one conversation, they talk about how boring jane is and that people like emma and frank are not to blame if they can't find the energy or time to try and coax jane out of her shell. both so arrogant, self-assured and individualistic, emma and frank for me are the perfect match.however, emma has claimed since the beginning of this book that she has never fallen in love and could never be capable of it hence her aversion towards marriage. i could easily surmise that she could have been an asexual which would be okay but i don't think austen ever intended her to be that which would have been more of a rewarding character twist, to be honest. it's worth nothing that even though emma does not want to involve herself in personal romantic entanglements, she is more than happy to insert herself in other people's love lives. austen plays this absurd character flaw of hers to a tee and i can admit that they are the instances in this novel that i find very enjoyable to peruse. it's the source of this book's conflicts. that being said, almost a good sixty percent of this four-hundred-seventy-seven-paged book is so fucking slow and repetitive. i even said during one of my status updates for my reading progress that the social interactions among characters that populate this book are the victorian-equivalent of facebook-ing. the content of these scenes and dialogue does not at all justify the length and i hated every goddamn minute i have to read through all the non-events that happened by the 180-paged mark. nothing monumental truly transpires after the amusing mr. elton-harriet-emma drama save for the scarce intriguing narrations concerning jane fairfax being a bore to emma (and emma feeling guilty about feeling that way), and emma's contemplation about her real feelings for frank; and whether or not she's attracted to him or not.emma does not end up with frank churchill, though. she ends up with mr. knightly, an old family friend who is ten or twelve years her senior. and it only took for harriet to realize that she might fancy mr. knightly for herself just so emma can realize too that she had always loved mr. knightly after all. wow. who knew that's all it takes? it would have been awesome if we cut out the tons of bullshit parties/get-togethers/whatever where random characters would gossip or charm each other so we could have arrived to this stellar revelation earlier but hey, austen felt like the other stupid parts of this book that i hated were important so--who i am to argue with a classical writer? i just never remember being this annoyed about minutiae descriptions of ordinary events in classical works unlike when i read an austen book. dickens, hugo, dumas, and doyle all have moments where they dwell on piles of descriptive narrative pertaining to scenes that are often not as relevant as others, but at least they kept it down to a minimum and go back to the purpose of their plot in the first place. with austen's emma, it was an indulgent feat that littered a great number of chapters for the second and third volume. by the three hundredth or s...   \n",

a little dry and frustrating to read at times. considering i am someone who reads a lot of young adult fiction, i am used to fast paced and easy reading, and emma was a lot of things but fast paced and easy are not two words that come to mind when i think about this book.however, some words that do come to mind are: funny, sweet, cute, witty, charming, romantic, and thought-provoking. emma was a new type of character for me. she was a genuinely nice person who wanted to be helpful, but she was also a spoiled snob who thought she knew what was best for everyone. the great thing about this book and the genius of jane austen is that despite her many faults, emma was still likable. but i can't count the number of times i wanted to reach into my kindle, shake some sense into that girl, and tell her to mind her own business. it all starts when emma meets a new friend harriet smith. harriet quickly becomes emma's pet, and emma quickly becomes harriet's heroine. early on in their friendship, harriet receives a proposal from a nice, successful farmer, but because emma is so fond of harriet, she thinks harriet is too good for this farmer and convinces the poor girl to turn him down and set her sights on a richer and more socially acceptable better man.this blunder on emma's part leads to some pretty funny and embarrassing moments for everyone. emma ends up with a completely different mindset about everything by the end of the book, and it was enjoyable reading about her journey and growth. she was never a cruel person and her snobbish behavior came from a good place believe it or not. in truth, harriet was someone way beneath emma's station, but she loved her as a sister almost immediately after meeting her. emma didn't so much need to learn to be a better person as much as she needed to learn to stop picking and choosing what other people needed to do with their lives. she also benefited from learning that she really didn't know half as much about people and life as she thought she did. as a fellow bossy busybody who has learned this particular lesson more times than i can count, it made emma very easy for me to relate to even though i disagreed with nearly every move she made. her heart was in the right place.  it was interesting to see how things came full circle and everyone ended up where they belonged in spite of (or maybe because of) emma's meddling. now i want to discuss emma's romance so look away if you don't want to be spoiled.(view spoiler)[emma falls for mr. knightly!! i wanted them to end up together the first time they interacted, but because of the age difference and their inability to stop fighting long enough to flirt, i wasn't so sure that was going to happen.the romance between emma and mr. knightly didn't seem like a forgone conclusion to me until the moment they danced at the ball, and that didn't happened until the book was more than halfway over. i just about leapt out of my bed and did a little jig when they finally stopped playfully bickering and got down to some real flirting.those two people couldn't have been more perfectly matched and i even got the \"happily ever after\" ending with a wedding that i never expect from older romantic books. *sigh*  (hide spoiler)] despite how long it was, this book was a joy to read from start to finish. i'm glad i took my time instead of rushing right through because i would have missed out on all the feelings i got to experience. i was so proud of the person emma became because i was so frustrated with the person she used to be. i made mention of emma's \"happily ever after\" in my spoiler, but every single character in this book got an \"ever after\" that was just as happy. not one person was left out of the joy.if all of jane austen's books are as romantic and fun as emma and pride and prejudice, i finally get why her works are still beloved and heavily consumed by romantics today. there is a sort of timelessness to her storytelling that transcends the dated but beautiful language. it may have taken her one hundred words to say what authors today convey with ten, but those one hundred words are worth it. i would only recommend emma to those of you who enjoy a nice slow building relationship. the payoff at the end of this book is incredible, but the journey could be a little tiring for some. if you like, classic novels, sweet romance, and interesting character growth, i would add this one to your book bucket list.this book is suitable for all ages, but i would suggest the reading level for ages 12 and up. this review was originally

inscrutable phineas fogg. fogg is described as mathmatical, punctual, wealthy, systematic, an english gentleman who is somewhat of an automon. today, we would say fogg has obsessive complusive disorder (ocd) or perhaps that he has asperger’s syndrome. nonethless, verne uses phineas fogg’s flat affect to create a sense of mystery ala his countryman victor hugo’s the count of monte cristo, while simultaneously brushing phineas fogg with a whimsy that embodies the victorian fantasy of worldwide travel. “phineas fogg was one of those mathematically exact people, who, never hurried and always ready, are economical of their steps and their motions. he never made one stride too many, always going by the shortest route. he did not give an idle look. he did not allow himself a superfluous gesture. he had never been seen to be moved or troubled. he was a man of the least possible haste, but he always arrived in time. however, it will be understood that he lived alone, and, so to speak, outside of every social relation. he knew that in life one must take his share of friction, and as frictions retard, he never rubbed against anyone.” pg 15originally written as contemporary fiction in 1872, today’s reader finds the book loaded with history. mid-way through a century of expansion from roughly 1814 to 1915, the british empire was the hegemonic power of the late nineteenth century. by 1915, it would rule just under 25% of the world’s land mass and population. in 1872, “…there is thus a track of english towns around the world” (pg 112). verne clearly wanted to provide his readers with various snapshots of the globe. for example, we learn that india had 180 million inhabitants (2016 population: 1.325 billion), of which 110 million were governed by the british. of course, travel by ship and train are discussed in reference to fogg and his valet, passepartout’s, discovery of india, but also customs of the land, as seen through european – particularly english – eyes.  “…the entrance into certain hindu pagodas is formally forbidden to christians, and next, that the believers themselves cannot enter there without having left their shoes at the door. it must be remarked here that the british government, for sound political reasons, respecting and causing to be respected in its most insignificant details the religion of the country, punishes severely whoever violates its practices.” pg. 52further insights are offered on lands the average english citizen would probably never visit, but longed to imagine. the japanese land of the rising sun is described as awash in color, an empire on the rise some 50 years before it would provoke world war ii. differences between china and japan duly noted including the japanese rejection of opium that enslaved china. the american transcontinental railroad, reputation for innovation to the point of foolishness, and tolerance of the strange system of mormonism whirl around fogg’s endeavor to cross north america. the changing references of time as one crosses meridians is explained, and indeed, much of the story turns on the tracking of time as mr. fogg is before and behind the progress required for him to win his bet that he can travel round the world in 80 days.victorian values are on display. these are notable throughout the journey, particularly in the complications of mr. fix, the british detective following the entourage in an attempt to connect our intrepid mr. fogg with a bank robbery. “this strictness of principles – this rigorous observance of legality – is easily explained with the english manners, which in the matter of personal liberty do not allow anything arbitrary.” pg 54these sentiments are notable to americans of today first because british law forms the foundation of our legal system, and second, because we used to be brothers – indeed the sons of england – who shared such principles. phineas is censured for the selfish absorption of his journey:  “the general saw in this bet only an eccentricitiy without a useful aim, and which was wanting necessarily in the transire benefaciendo which ought to guide every reasonable man. in the manner in which this singular gentleman was moving on, he would evidentally be doing nothing, either for himself or for others.” pg. 58the trade in opium is referenced as an embarrassment to british honor. lying is despised is one’s self and others. passepartout is concerned about providing loyal and effective service to his boss. widow burning is deplored, and the limits of the british empire, which allowed it to continue under local rajas, is mourned. the american civil war victory freeing africans from american bondage is applauded, and the polygamy of mormons is rendered incomprehensible. did you know this book is one of 54 novels that verne wrote in series? i didn’t. the series is called voyages extraordinaires, and each title was meticulously researched with the intention of creating encyclopedic novels by which readers could learn about various social science (geography, cultures, etc) and scientific ideas (geology, weather cycles, etc). verne was passionate about this endeavor and is quoted as saying, “it is my intention to complete, before my working days are done, a series which shall conclude in story form my whole survey of the world’s surface and the heavens; there are still left corners of the world to which my thoughts have not yet penetrated. as you know, i have dealt with the moon, but a great deal remains to be done, and if health and strength permit me, i hope to finish the task.” two additionally famous titles in verne's series are journey to the center of the earth (1864) and twenty-thousand leagues under the sea. rollicking adventures that were the highest form of media in their day, all three of these publications have been made into feature length films numerous times. while they went about their work differently, two other prolific authors of verne's time were also working on series that ran from the 50s to the 100s of titles. both citizens of the british empire, they were the scotsman r.m ballantyne (1825-1894) and the english war correspondent/ author, g.a. henty (1832-1902). this is a lovely ride, full of colorful experiences, “mild peril,” and mysterious suspense. geography assignments could easily track fogg’s journey via 1872 locations, or by using google to identify historical names, a modern map. one can see why it is considered a classic, and can feel confident recommending it to readers of all ages. the count of

disorder (ocd) or perhaps that he has asperger’s syndrome. nonethless, verne uses phineas fogg’s flat affect to create a sense of mystery ala his countryman victor hugo’s the count of monte cristo, while simultaneously brushing phineas fogg with a whimsy that embodies the victorian fantasy of worldwide travel. “phineas fogg was one of those mathematically exact people, who, never hurried and always ready, are economical of their steps and their motions. he never made one stride too many, always going by the shortest route. he did not give an idle look. he did not allow himself a superfluous gesture. he had never been seen to be moved or troubled. he was a man of the least possible haste, but he always arrived in time. however, it will be understood that he lived alone, and, so to speak, outside of every social relation. he knew that in life one must take his share of friction, and as frictions retard, he never rubbed against anyone.” pg 15originally written as contemporary fiction in 1872, today’s reader finds the book loaded with history. mid-way through a century of expansion from roughly 1814 to 1915, the british empire was the hegemonic power of the late nineteenth century. by 1915, it would rule just under 25% of the world’s land mass and population. in 1872, “…there is thus a track of english towns around the world” (pg 112). verne clearly wanted to provide his readers with various snapshots of the globe. for example, we learn that india had 180 million inhabitants (2016 population: 1.325 billion), of which 110 million were governed by the british. of course, travel by ship and train are discussed in reference to fogg and his valet, passepartout’s, discovery of india, but also customs of the land, as seen through european – particularly english – eyes.  “…the entrance into certain hindu pagodas is formally forbidden to christians, and next, that the believers themselves cannot enter there without having left their shoes at the door. it must be remarked here that the british government, for sound political reasons, respecting and causing to be respected in its most insignificant details the religion of the country, punishes severely whoever violates its practices.” pg. 52further insights are offered on lands the average english citizen would probably never visit, but longed to imagine. the japanese land of the rising sun is described as awash in color, an empire on the rise some 50 years before it would provoke world war ii. differences between china and japan duly noted including the japanese rejection of opium that enslaved china. the american transcontinental railroad, reputation for innovation to the point of foolishness, and tolerance of the strange system of mormonism whirl around fogg’s endeavor to cross north america. the changing references of time as one crosses meridians is explained, and indeed, much of the story turns on the tracking of time as mr. fogg is before and behind the progress required for him to win his bet that he can travel round the world in 80 days.victorian values are on display. these are notable throughout the journey, particularly in the complications of mr. fix, the british detective following the entourage in an attempt to connect our intrepid mr. fogg with a bank robbery. “this strictness of principles – this rigorous observance of legality – is easily explained with the english manners, which in the matter of personal liberty do not allow anything arbitrary.” pg 54these sentiments are notable to americans of today first because british law forms the foundation of our legal system, and second, because we used to be brothers – indeed the sons of england – who shared such principles. phineas is censured for the selfish absorption of his journey:  “the general saw in this bet only an eccentricitiy without a useful aim, and which was wanting necessarily in the transire benefaciendo which ought to guide every reasonable man. in the manner in which this singular gentleman was moving on, he would evidentally be doing nothing, either for himself or for others.” pg. 58the trade in opium is referenced as an embarrassment to british honor. lying is despised is one’s self and others. passepartout is concerned about providing loyal and effective service to his boss. widow burning is deplored, and the limits of the british empire, which allowed it to continue under local rajas, is mourned. the american civil war victory freeing africans from american bondage is applauded, and the polygamy of mormons is rendered incomprehensible. did you know this book is one of 54 novels that verne wrote in series? i didn’t. the series is called voyages extraordinaires, and each title was meticulously researched with the intention of creating encyclopedic novels by which readers could learn about various social science (geography, cultures, etc) and scientific ideas (geology, weather cycles, etc). verne was passionate about this endeavor and is quoted as saying, “it is my intention to complete, before my working days are done, a series which shall conclude in story form my whole survey of the world’s surface and the heavens; there are still left corners of the world to which my thoughts have not yet penetrated. as you know, i have dealt with the moon, but a great deal remains to be done, and if health and strength permit me, i hope to finish the task.” two additionally famous titles in verne's series are journey to the center of the earth (1864) and twenty-thousand leagues under the sea. rollicking adventures that were the highest form of media in their day, all three of these publications have been made into feature length films numerous times. while they went about their work differently, two other prolific authors of verne's time were also working on series that ran from the 50s to the 100s of titles. both citizens of the british empire, they were the scotsman r.m ballantyne (1825-1894) and the english war correspondent/ author, g.a. henty (1832-1902). this is a lovely ride, full of colorful experiences, “mild peril,” and mysterious suspense. geography assignments could easily track fogg’s journey via 1872 locations, or by using google to identify historical names, a modern map. one can see why it is considered a classic, and can feel confident recommending it to readers of all ages. the count of

       "90065   a blackbird used to sing outside my window. he put a smile on my face when i woke every morning, and he was there when i went to sleep. his song was the first thing i heard when i walked up my path after having been away from home for a while. he would sing all day and even some of the evening and night, proudly chorusing his own short refrains, the songs he had taught himself. he had three songs, all of just five notes each, and one of these was his especial favourite which he would repeat over and over again. not for him were the complicated warbles and song structures of his fellow birds. occasionally he would experiment; a twitter here, a different note there, but then he would confidently return to his favourites, and sing them loudly, his heart fit to burst. he gloried in his song, and i delighted in it. then last week nothing. there is a hole in my life now; something is missing - something of beauty has gone. i feel bereft, as if someone close to me has died. and sometimes, reading this book i would fleetingly experience a similar sense of loss.\"mockingbirds don't do one thing but make music for us to enjoy... sing their hearts out for us. that's why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.\"mockingbirds are a recurring theme in harper lee's only novel. to kill a mockingbird, first published in 1960, is justly a classic. it won the pulitzer prize, and is studied by almost every schoolchild in the usa. in the uk it has been on the national curriculum on and off for a few decades. the first half of the book deals entirely with a small town in the southern united states, a fictitious small town of maycomb, alabama. it describes the events there, during three years of the great depression 1933-35. the events are described as if they are seen by a young girl, six-year-old scout finch. she talks of the special places she loves, the townspeople who live there and their daily lives. for an english reader it is very reminiscent of \"cider with rosie,\" in that it conveys a particular place and time, which has now been lost. also like \"cider with rosie\" the child's point of view evokes feelings of nostalgia, but without sentimentality.scout is caught up in her own world, involving her older brother, jem, and her father, whom she calls by his name of \"atticus\". the children befriend a boy named dill, who stays nearby with his aunt each summer. they invent their own games, and fantasies, one of which involves a neighbour \"boo\" radley, the son of a reclusive family. this is fine fodder for the children, who are in turn terrified of, and fascinated by, boo radley, although few people have ever seen him. the narrator explains the history of the radley family, and what has led to the present situation. the first part of the book thus deals entirely with this childhood, and the reader learns through scout's eyes, the habits and attitudes of the maycomb residents, in preparation for what is to follow. scout is beginning to develop both her attitudes and her moral compass. she has an aversion to all things girlish, and because this is a story reported in flashback, harper lee shows that scout is to become a feminist, for the narrator jean louise (\"scout\") still has an ambivalence about being a southern lady. the child scout also has burgeoning feelings of her sense of fair play, constantly challenging instances in her life, both great and small, which seem wrong to her. one of the most humorous early parts of the novel is the description of the hapless teacher, unused to these maycomb children, trying to instigate her modern city ways and educational methods. the indignation scout feels at being disbelieved when she tells her teacher that she can already read, is very entertaining. scout is told that she must undo the damage atticus has done, and forbid atticus from teaching her further. scout's first day in school is of course a satirical treatment of education; harper lee is mocking it. this part of the novel only refers obliquely to what will be the main theme of the second part.(view spoiler)[ the reader learns that their father has been asked by judge taylor to defend tom robinson, a black man who has been accused of raping a young white woman, mayella ewell. (hide spoiler)] the children become very involved with events, and these teach them about the endemic prejudice in this small town, enabling them to form ideas about those who maintain an unjust system, and those who are fighting against it, in varying degrees. the story is exceptionally moving, involving mob mentality, courage, murder, rape, class and gender issues and conflicts, courage and compassion.harper lee has said that she thinks an author, \"should write about what he knows and write truthfully\". she has denied that this novel is an autobiography, and yet there are many parallels with people and events from her own childhood. for instance, harper lee's father was an attorney, similar to atticus finch,(view spoiler)[ and in 1919, he defended two black men accused of murder. (it was his final criminal case; they were convicted, hanged and reportedly mutilated.) (hide spoiler)] her father was also the editor and publisher of the monroeville newspaper. in to kill a mockingbird scout's mother died when she was a baby, so is absent in the novel. although harper lee was 25 when her mother, (whose maiden name was \"finch\") died, she did have a nervous condition which made her mentally and emotionally absent. the author also had a brother who was four years older than her, just as jem was four years older than scout. and the family had a black housekeeper, who came daily, just as calpurnia does in to kill a mockingbird.harper lee once said, in a 1964 interview, that her aspiration was, \"to be the jane austen of south alabama.\" on a superficial level, anyone less like jane austen would be hard to imagine! yet they both have the same underlying sentiment. they both challenged the social status quo and valued individual worth over social standing. for instance, in one episode calpurnia chastises and punishes scout, because she embarrasses her poorer white classmate, walter cunningham. atticus respects and endorses calpurnia's judgment, even later in the book standing up to his formidable sister, alexandra, when she wants to fire calpurnia. as scout herself grows and develops through the book, she begins to view the women of the town, the \"missionary ladies\" with a satirical eye, thus alienating herself from their influence.the character of tom robinson seems to have been inspired by several events, rather than one actual person.(view spoiler)[ when harper lee was 10 years old, there was a story and local trial covered by her father's newspaper. a white woman near monroeville had accused a black man of raping her. another case at the time was of a black teenager, who was murdered for flirting with a white woman in mississippi in 1955. others have claimed that the book might have been partly inspired by a notorious case in which nine black men were convicted of raping two white women on negligible evidence. (hide spoiler)] however, in 2005, harper lee denied any one influence, although she said that several of them served \"the same purpose\" - that of displaying southern prejudices. it is now thought that this novel, in particular the tom robinson character, acted as a catalyst for the civil rights movement. (view spoiler)[the jury at tom robinson's trial were poor white farmers, who convicted him despite overwhelming evidence of his innocence. in the background many more educated and moderate white townspeople hid behind the law and supported the jury's decision. atticus finch speaks here, as reported by scout,\"\"why reasonable people go stark raving mad when anything involving a negro comes up is something i don't pretend to understand...i just hope that jem and scout come to me for their answers instead of listening to the town\"... i never figured out how atticus knew i was listening, and it was not until many years later that i realized he wanted me to hear every word he said.\" (hide spoiler)]this second part of the novel tells unpalatable truths. it reflects a whole spectrum of views, many nuances of prejudice. but it is very tough to read. harper lee had a piercing eye, and she did not flinch from telling the truth about people, ugly as it is. significant social change was inevitable, but also was the fact that it would be conflict-ridden.the parallels in to kill a mockingbird with harper lee's own life continue. down the street from them lived a family whose house was always boarded up, and when the son got into some trouble the family's father kept him hidden at home for 24 years out of shame. this family seem uncannily like the radleys.but perhaps the most striking resemblance to her life is the character of dill, whom harper lee based on her childhood friend, truman capote. as a child, truman capote lived next door to harper lee, with his aunts, while his mother visited new york city. the author has built capote's imaginative talent for fantasising and story-telling into the character of dill. just as the two children were both boyish (the author was a tomboy) but also loved to read, so were scout and dill. both felt alienated from their peers. because of these strong connections, and the reticence of harper lee to be interviewed about to kill a mockingbird a sort of mythology seems to have grown up around the author. it is claimed that she is reclusive, and there are even rumours that truman capote, with his greater acknowledged body of work, was the true author of this novel too. but in a 2011 interview, harper lee finally said why she never wrote again, \"two reasons; one, i wouldn't go through the pressure and publicity i went through with \"to kill a mockingbird\" for any amount of money. second, i have said what i wanted to say and i will not say it again.\"additionally a letter written by truman capote has been donated to monroeville's museum.

                                                                                                                                                     you know it’s a good book when it makes a grown man cry….“people generally see what they look for, and hear what they listen for.”i’ve been putting off reading this book for so long, i have forgotten why… i’m glad that i can finally announce to the world, that i’ve read this all-time classic. it is an immensely well written, morally inspiring and highly enjoyable book. i’m sure this was not the last time that i’ll read “to kill a mockingbird”.i admit, initially i wasn’t going to award this work with 5 stars – the book was not 100% up my alley. not that i thought there was anything wrong with it, but well, i’m just not a big fan of books set in early 20th century america – don’t ask me why, i can’t put a finger on it. so yes, i was immediately put off after the first few pages. however, i soon started to realise why this piece of literature is so famed and critical to read.“sometimes the bible in the hand of one man is worse than a whisky bottle in the hand of (another)... there are just some kind of men who - who're so busy worrying about the next world they've never learned to live in this one, and you can look down the street and see the results.”one of the factors that make this book so special is harper lee’s writing style. though i admit – that one did not hit me straight away. until i started to think about it, i didn’t realise just how amazing it was. the quotes themselves are enough to blow your mind and make you weep, but when you stop and think how tough it must’ve been to write about something so serious and important in a way that this entertaining and inspiring whilst writing from a kid’s perspective. i mean just wow. it amazes me how the author was able to paint such a vivid picture of the courthouse (and pretty much life itself) and still retain that childish innocence and humour in her writing. hats off, no doubt.another thing that one cannot help but notice is the themes and moral lessons within the story. the book touches upon: racial injustice, different classes within a society, gender, courage, compassion and the law itself. and these lessons are powerful if one chooses to listen – no wonder this book is a required reading in many schools. it teaches you how to reach a deeper understanding of yourself as well as how to grow both morally and ethically. this book is one of those you wish you could make everyone in the world read (though i guess unless you choose to do it yourself and really dive into it, it won’t make much difference.) i feel so embarrassed that i had waited until my 20th birthday to read this book, you don’t even know… “we're paying the highest tribute you can pay a man. we trust him to do right. it's that simple.”lastly, i would say that this book has some of the most memorable characters i’d ever come across. i am normally drawn towards very grey-ish characters rather than classical black and white and though this novel certainly has some, one cannot fail to notice that the majority can be categorised into ‘good’ or ‘bad’. this would normally pain me very much however, it somehow seems not to be a problem in this book. the characters are just wonderfully written – atticus, scout, jem; they all come alive in your imagination and somehow seem to stick there long after you’re done reading. i am just in awe. this book is a must-read; it is as simple as that. don’t wait too long to pick it up if you haven’t already - you won’t regret it.    \n",

by william golding. it tells the story of a large group of schoolboys who are stranded on an island after an evacuation plane crashes. miles away from any civilization, the boys have to become organized into a loose society to survive. what starts out as a functioning civilization quickly devolves into two warring factions separated by ideals.ralph, the fair-haired, level-headed boy leads the group that believes getting home is above all else, while jack, the bad-tempered redhead is less concerned about rescue and more interested in hunting.i very much enjoyed this book and i my favourite part of it is the very end, when the boys realize what they've done and start crying like the children they are, while the naval officer looks on, \"...moved and a little embarrassed.\"i would recommend this book to anyone that enjoys dystopian fiction, as the book provides a perspective on how easily a society can be destroyed by infighting, fear, and the struggle for power.   \n",

                                first things first (i'm the realest) this book took me an embarrassingly long time to finish. i really enjoyed the story but found myself in a bit of a reading slump between exams, work and social stuff. the trouble i have with classics, although i really enjoy reading them, is that they require so much more focus for me. i have to sit and really think about what i'm reading and for this reason i struggle to find the time to get through it. i can't read a classic for ten minutes- i either read it for half an hour (or more) or not at all. this is the second jane austen novel i have read and i think it is on par with pride and prejudice. initially i found marianne to be quite frustrating; she is such a hopeless romantic that she forgets common sense. elinor was a little too sensible for my liking... i kind of thought she was boring. honestly though, i was really surprised by how emotionally invested i became in the story and the lives of the dashwood girls. i cried at the end (i cry over a lot of things but whatever). i really loved the characters. they were all so vivid and full of spirit. mrs jennings was an excellent character. i found willoughby and lucy steele to be deplorable- there were other characters i disliked but i thought these two were the worst of them.jane austen is an amazing author and i completely understand why she is the standard to which all authors aspire. i will definitely read more of her work at some stage, but maybe at a time when i have more spare time to dedicate to long reading sessions.    \n",

                            one of my absolute favourite books, which i have read multiple times. a major classic. if at all possible, get an edition with the original illustrations.___________________________________(expanded review based on conversation with jordan)here in switzerland, l'affaire du mot n hasn't quite had the high profile it's received on its home territory. in fact, i'm embarrassed to admit that i hadn't even heard of it until jordan gave me a few pointers earlier today. so, no doubt all this has been said before, but i still can't resist the temptation to add my two centimes worth.in case you're as ignorant as i was about hot topics in the literary world, the furore concerns an edition of huckleberry finn in which the word 'nigger' has been systematically replaced with 'slave'. my initial response was plain surprise. one of the aspects of the book i enjoy most is twain's appallingly exact ear for dialogue. he's reproducing the language actually used in the american south of the 1840s, and this, above all, is what gives the novel its force; so why on earth would anyone want to change it? for example, here's huck's paw in full flow:\"oh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful. why, looky here. there was a free nigger there from ohio -- a mulatter, most as white as a white man. he had the whitest shirt on you ever see, too, and the shiniest hat; and there ain't a man in that town that's got as fine clothes as what he had; and he had a gold watch and chain, and a silver-headed cane -- the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the state. and what do you think? they said he was a p'fessor in a college, and could talk all kinds of languages, and knowed everything. and that ain't the wust. they said he could vote when he was at home. well, that let me out. thinks i, what is the country a-coming to? it was 'lection day, and i was just about to go and vote myself if i warn't too drunk to get there; but when they told me there was a state in this country where they'd let that nigger vote, i drawed out. i says i'll never vote agin. them's the very words i said; they all heard me; and the country may rot for all me -- i'll never vote agin as long as i live. and to see the cool way of that nigger -- why, he wouldn't a give me the road if i hadn't shoved him out o' the way. i says to the people, why ain't this nigger put up at auction and sold? -- that's what i want to know. and what do you reckon they said? why, they said he couldn't be sold till he'd been in the state six months, and he hadn't been there that long yet. there, now -- that's a specimen. they call that a govment that can't sell a free nigger till he's been in the state six months. here's a govment that calls itself a govment, and lets on to be a govment, and thinks it is a govment, and yet's got to set stock-still for six whole months before it can take a hold of a prowling, thieving, infernal, white-shirted free nigger.i'm sorry, but i'm honestly unable to see how anyone could think the above passage was racist or might be improved by substituting 'slave' for 'nigger'. it's incidents like this which create the popular european myth that americans don't understand the concept of irony.if you're curious to know more about the tradition of improving great works of literature by removing dubious words, you might want to take a quick look at the wikipedia article on thomas bowdler which jordan and i were giggling over. bowdler, it turns out, had acted from the best of motives. when he was young, his father had entertained him by reading aloud from shakespeare; butlater, bowdler realised his father had been extemporaneously omitting or altering passages he felt unsuitable for the ears of his wife and children. bowdler felt it would be worthwhile to present an edition which might be used in a family whose father was not a sufficiently \"circumspect and judicious reader\" to accomplish this expurgation himself.he undertook to create a suitably amended version. or, to be exact, he got his sister to do it and then gave out the books under his own name. again, his reasons were unimpeachable: it would have reflected badly on her to admit that she had understood the naughtier passages. i won't criticise dr bowdler or his equally well-meaning modern followers. i just think it's a shame mark twain never had the opportunity to write a story about them.   \n",

\"the adventures of tom sawyer\"...remember i have an english degree, but i am catching up on the \"classics\". as a middle school student, and even high school, twain did not appeal to me. i believe the first work of his that i read was his \"adam and eve\" interpretation. that did it for me, twain was brilliant! still, i have many of his works to read. i appreciate tom's humor, especially his viewpoint on becky and how to win her over, her reactions to him, her own deviousness and plotting, his disappointment in an elderly member of town not dying on a timely manner...i appreciate tom's honesty, his loyalty, his conniving, his true love for aunt polly...so many ways. i love tom and huck's friendship...and look forward to huck's own adventures. yes, \"the adventures of tom sawyer\" has the word \"nigger\" in it...it was written in 1876...there are negative things written very briefly about black characters, and also some kind words as well. i suspect that native americans have an equal right to dislike their own characterization in the novel, in the character of \"injun joe\"...a murderer and thief. still, a true american novel...a young man's timeless adventures.   \n",

                                                       “so endeth this chronicle. it being strictly a history of a boy, it must stop here; the story could not go much further without it becoming the history of a man. when one writes a novel about grown people, he knows exactly where to stop—that is, with a marriage; but when he writes of juveniles, he must stop where he best can.”this concluding idea is from mark twain’s classic “tom sawyer”. twain presents another conquest of prose and wit that conveys deeply personal and meaningful human experiences as illustrated by the adventures of the rascal-boy tom and his friends as they grow up in 19th century america. in a self-aware and sarcastic style that only twain masters, he is able to reflect the childhood consciousness—its quaintness, its hilarity, its pain, its significance, its self-importance, in a way that is at once biting and soft.as the above quote demonstrates so well, mark twain proves he is the king of authorial self-awareness in narrative asides like this one, which make him impervious to criticism because, well, he’s thought of it first. he provides explanation for why he did things the way he did (i.e. why end there in tom’s life) his self-awareness, along with his omnipresence as the narrator leads us to believe in his omniscience. i love his comment after tom’s embarrassing sunday school slip up where he calls david and goliath the first of jesus’ disciples—“let us draw a curtain of charity over the rest of the scene.” the story becomes more alive because it’s as if it’s being told to you not only by a good friend but a wickedly funny one. attention is freely given and trusting readers fall easily into the rhythm his confident narration creates. and that’s another appeal of his writing—his ability to exactly describe the thoughts of a child, and then elevate their register. take for example this passage: “now as to this girl. what had he done? nothing. he had meant the best in the world, and been treated like a dog—like a very dog. she would be sorry some day—maybe when it was too late. ah, if he could only die temporarily. but the elastic heart of youth cannot be compressed into one constrained shape a long time. tom presently began to drift insensibly back into the concerns of this life again.”the appeal of the writing comes in his precision of expression (desire to die temporarily, elastic heart of youth), the humorous undertones (which lovingly make light of the pangs of innocent childhood troubles), and the ease of his dialogue. it is also through dialogue that twain effectively illustrates the central theme of tom’s coming of age. in the words he says (as well as the thoughts expressed by the omniscient narrator) we see tom become more outwardly focused—he grows up. i think it’s a comforting and helpful to see the process of maturation in others, and it most definitely was helpful for me when i read it the first time as a child.in my mind, though, what tom sawyer a such a good read post-childhood (and what makes twain a great writer) is his ability to intermingle broad human truths casually, almost unaffectedly, together with the quotidian anecdotes. an example is tom whitewashing the fence: “if he had been a great philosopher…he would now have comprehended that work consists of whatever a body is obliged to do, and that play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do.” this nugget of real lofty thought, though meriting real reflection is just as soon grounded again to the level of the young boy whose story this is: “the boy mused awhile over the substantial change which had taken place in his worldly circumstances, and then wended toward head-quarter to report.” his writing style as much as content reflects the sporadic inspirations amidst humdrum kid-life common in childhood. of course, other twain staples could be addressed—his regional mastery in dialogue, his vivid language in place descriptions, his superb brevity, among other things. but most importantly, in tom sawyer he achieves a exceptional ode to childhood— snapshots of growing pains, moments of glory, hysterical incidents—all in a form that perfectly suits the content.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       “the adventures of tom sawyer” is the first mark twain book i’ve read. i was pleasured to realize a large chunk of the book was parodied in a simpsons episode, where bart plays hooky from school, observes, or thinks he observes, a murder of a waiter over chowder, and the entire bit about the trial that goes on, and the man jumping out the window. i haven’t seen that episode in a long while, and much wish to see it again now that i’ve read “tom sawyer”.in terms of readability, i thought, going in, that twain would be very dry, long-winded, old-fashioned, with much abbreviations in dialogue as well as slang. the book was much easier to follow along than i anticipated, however. the slang that is used is reserved to dialogue, and mostly just from huck.i was surprised how much of a role huckleberry finn plays in the book; i expected him only to make a cameo at the end of the story. i had a fanboy moment when he first appeared, even though i haven’t read his own story yet. i really liked his introduction with the dead cat. another thing i was curious about with twain was the frequency with which he used the word ‘nigger’; i know, or thought i knew, he used it a lot in huck finn, like above two hundred times, but i wasn’t sure if this one had it. for the entire story up until huck appeared, blacks were referred to as negroes, i believe, but huck always calls them niggers. i like how twain presented his characters’ attitudes towards blacks though. there’s sort of this distance he treats them with, close to or avowedly looking at them as inferior to whites, but at the same time both tom and huck seem to tolerate them being around, and confess to each other that there’s negroes they actually like, though they don’t want that to get known publicly. in that way, the characters themselves sort of view blacks as equals, but they know society wouldn’t tolerate that, so they’re almost forced to at least publicly look down on them. it’s hard to explain, but i hope you get the gist of what i’m trying to say.one thing that did infuriate me about the writing was twain’s repetition of the word “presently”. it irritated the hell out of me! it becomes such a distraction, every time i see the word, i sigh and shake my head; it’s completely an unnecessary word, the sentences work just fine without it, and it is a very noticeable word. half-way into the book, i was on full-alert for uses of the word. that really sucked a lot of my enjoyment from the book because it became such a distraction. in the latter quarter of the book, twain also became repetitive with the phrase “by and by”, including starting back-to-back paragraphs off with the phrase. altogether, i just think that’s bad writing/editing. in terms of plot, i think the book was okay. some of the adventures the characters undertake reminded me of ones i myself did, and the way they came up with games and adventures brought back memories. the word chapter i think was the one on the master’s gilded dome, where the students seek to embarrass their strict teacher. the writing in this chapter just appeared entirely different than the rest of the story, and it’s the only part of the book i just gave up reading halfway, and moved on to the next chapter. all in all, i think the book is okay. i don’t really see any reason why this book should be a classic; the writing and plot is not great; i’ve read stories by no-name authors i’ve enjoyed more and thought were better written than this. i think the book is more of a classic because for that time, perhaps, stories like this were rare, or because twain was one of the early american writers, perhaps the first great american novelist. but that aside, i don’t think the story or writing was all that great. an okay book, sure, a good book, fair enough, but a masterpiece?i'm torn between two or three stars. rounding up. three stars.   \n",

but by so doing, you run no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him. wherefore, it seems to me you had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this leviathan.melville employs a fragment of job 1:15 for the epigram of the epilogue: \"...and i only am escaped alone to tell thee.\" in the same way, the reader, after 625 pages of pure sublime masterwork, escapes alone to tell others of the experience. and it is a large, profound experience. as melville says himself, through his surrogate ishmael, \"to produce a mighty book, you must choose a mighty theme\" (497). having found success with his first two novels, \\ntypee: a peep at polynesian life\\n and \\nomoo: a narrative of adventures in the south seas\\n, and then failure with his third, \\nmardi and a voyage thither\\n, a dense philosophical work, melville seems to have found the aristotelian golden mean in the genesis of american literature: the mighty \\nmoby-dick or, the whale\\n.i avoided the book for a long time, daunted as i was by its heft and, well, age and subject matter. yet, as thomas c. foster points out in his book \\nhow to read literature like a professor: a lively and entertaining guide to reading between the lines\\n, it was really my own age that was the impasse: \"...[moby-dick] succeeds by rules of narrative that not many people can grasp (especially at the age of seventeen or twenty, when most of us get fouled in its lines)\" (243). indeed, a book like this makes tall demands of its readership. for example, one should at least be conversational about the \\ntanakh: the holy scriptures\\n, especially in its king james translation; one should have at least a basic familiarity with the great shakespearean tragedies and its chief figures (lear, othello, hamlet, macbeth); and one should have an understanding of the major metaphysical arguments before and of melville's time (hume versus kant; free will versus determinism, etc.). but, really, above all, the \\nking james bible touch\\n is paramount. as the great canadian literary critic northrop frye has it in his book \\nthe great code: the bible and literature\\n, \"...a student of english literature who does not know the bible does not understand a good deal of what is going on in what he reads\" (xii).melville's great book suffers from the same social stigma as so many others, the bible included. along with, say, \\nthe scarlet letter\\n, \\nthe adventures of huckleberry finn\\n, and \\nuncle tom's cabin\\n, people have heard so much about the books, that they feel they have already read them. this sentiment leads to italo calvino's cheeky definition of a classic in his book \\nwhy read the classics?\\n as being a book that one is always \"re-reading,\" never reading for the first time. to be sure, this can also be because one is embarrassed to admit that one has not read some great work or another before. for myself, i didn't read moby-dick until 8 years ago, at age 24, in grad school. and even then, my professor didn't do much to give me a leg up when she said, \"i'm sorry to do this, but, you'll have to do a close-reading of moby-dick; there's no way around it.\" luckily, though i didn't quite take to it on the first reading as i did on this second reading, the experience was peculiar and never left me. when i attempted to negatively criticize it, my arguments were glaringly thin. harold bloom, in \\nthe western canon: the books and school of the ages\\n sums it up best when he says, \"when you read a canonical work for a first time you encounter a stranger, an uncanny startlement rather than a fulfillment of expectations\" (3).most people are familiar with the opening sentence (you've likely just thought it). indeed even people who despise literature and always watched the movie of the books they were to read in school still know the famous line. i thought about this a while and questioned what it is about the line that is so catchy. (and, really, when read with the rest of the paragraph, it is a bit clunky.) then i started thinking through other great literature and riffling through opening sentences for possible iambic pentameters, when i came face to face with none other than \"in the beginning.\" now, i'm sure this has been pointed out before, given the welter of melville scholarship out there, but still it fills one with enthusiasm.in general, it is the opening sentence (featured on a coffee mug of famous opening sentence i bought at the nypl) and the mad ahab out to catch the white whale that people know of the book. scarcely much more, save for maybe the ambiguity of the dynamic between ishmael and queequeg. to know only these two elements of the main plot of the book is to know very little of its bulk, for these takeaways can be gleaned from the first chapter and last three chapters. there are still 131 other chapters! another stigma that has attached itself to the book like a barnacle to a whale is that it is bloated with outdated whaling lore and purports to be an encyclopedia of whaling. like most stigmas, there is truth to this, but allow me to assert my argument for undertaking such a reading project as this without resorting to abridgment.spending, let's say, a month of your life reading moby-dick is not to spend a month reading only one book. it is to spend a month reading through a library: \"there are certain books that, in themselves, are an ideal library. examples: moby-dick....\" (269, \\na reader on reading\\n). again, like the bible (which is also considered a library), this book is not a novel; it is composed of plays, poems, prose poems, narrative, essays, scholarly treatises, philosophy, theology, and more. melville displays his acumen as a sort of polyglot of genres. where cervantes gives us interpolated stories, melville gives us interpolated essays. through ishmael, we get a genius's thoughts on all manner of the popular and the esoteric (melville was considerably well read) synthesized into the metaphor of the human pushing to the brink of madness to capture an elusive whale. the more i think about this major theme of the book, the more i realize how inclusive, how universal it is. yet, it is distinctly american. whereas faust sold his soul to mephistopheles, ahab looks to himself to obtain his goal.approaching the book in thirds is a good way to plan your reading project. the first third introduces the principal characters and sets us off on the pequod on christmas day (i.e. christ's traditional birth date). the second third gives us the weight of scholarly discourse on whaling, but melville rewards the alert reader with constant dips into the poetic and philosophical modes. finally, the last third, the extended climax of the book, pays off with dividends for the efforts of the reader. this is a book best read at a slow pace. i recommend no more than 20 pages a day, in order to properly ingest and absorb the glut of its offerings.the undeniable standout character is, of course, that black hole ahab, into which everything on its event horizon is pulled and out of which nothing escapes. melville transcends himself with ahab. the shakespearean soliloquies (for even when he speaks to others, he is really just speaking to himself) take up the torch passed from shakespeare to milton and now to melville. ahab captures the viscera of the american spirit in a way that ishmael just cannot, clinging to reason above all. where ishmael says \"give me the privilege of making my own summer with my own coals,\" ahab, in the face of death, proclaims, \"to the last i grapple with thee; from hell's heart i stab at thee; for hate's sake i spit my last breath at thee\" (12, 623).i glance through all of my marginalia, post-it notes, highlighting, etc., and i am overwhelmed with all there is to say of this great book. perhaps one day i will set to the task of distilling all of these notes and thoughts into a long essay (really, only another book will come closer to doing it justice), but--alas--i must bring this \"review\" to a close. suffice it to say this: in job 41:1, god says to job, \"canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook?\" melville's ahab answers with a mad, \"yes, i can.\" who would not want to read a book written about the man who, unlike job, set out to defy god's limitation on mankind? a mighty theme indeed.   \n",

                        there is an author's note at the end explaining the intent of his writing the novel, and the reason it is set in america and not europe or rather russia.don't get me wrong, the book truly deserves the title of a modern classic, and you get lost in the beautiful world created by the author that for a second, you forget english is not his first language (when you read the author's letter, you'll know why i mentioned it). in fact, few books engage all your senses; sight, smell, sound as well as touch. so immersive is this novel that you feel you are in the car as humbert and lo drive through the country. no, not as a passenger but in the mind of humbert himself. (as a noob writer, i struggle when it comes to describing a scene and this book is more than a revelation to me).but somewhere in between, you look up mid reading and remember that lo is just 12 and you can't help but internally debate whether you should continue or not. after all, well, i guess everyone has heard of lolita at one point in their life. the reaction can be any, embarrassed, disgusted, revolted, shiver of terror. be as it may, when you sit down and read the novel, you are reminded of how beautiful a book can be, in spite of its scandalous theme. and let me tell you, the book is more than what people perceive it as. and that is what i believe makes it a classic. the writing claws its way into the reader and forces them into a submissive state, letting them go only when the book is finished. but if you think it's over when you turn the last page over, oh my dear, you are so wrong. a truly great book will find a place in your deep consciousness, staying there till the end. at least that's what i feel.irrelevant verdict: yes. obviously, it is a must-read.    \n",

 ok, deep breath here...i haven't read, or better to say understood, homer as much as i ought to. i've picked up and put down the odyssey a few times and i just hate to admit that it's not clicking for my modern mind as much as it ought to. it's not the deep brow'd blind sage, it's me. did not read it in high school, was unfortunately lacking in my ancient greek history and mythos (getting better, hopefully) and therefore the gods, and gods upon gods, and the drama between them all plays out so intricately that my eyes start to wobble and my head it spins. man, do i hate admitting it, and in the sparkling company of goodreads at that, but it's just the damn truth. i like to quietly judge people who don't dig the classics because their \"boring\" or \"weird\" or \"long-winded\" or \"old fashioned\" as much as anybody, but in this case i have met the enemy and he is me.homer's one of those writers who hover over...well...everything, of course. my beloved joyce puts him to some obvious use in the obvious place. philosophy professors are always referencing it, nietzsche and bernard williams like to use him, keats, pound, milton, etc etc...it's the kind of thing that a voracious reader will sort of get an inkling of even if they've never actually cracked the pages themselves. isn't it strange how that happens?so i am now no longer burdened by master's thesis woes (passed! on my birthday, no less! whut whut!) and thus am free to tackle a big dog guilt-free. i just cannot call myself an educated reader without having the homer in my brain-shelf, i just can't. it really is a kind of shame that it's not as central a part of the curriculum as it used to be...i'm embarrassed by how little i really know about these characters, or rather how much i thought i knew and really hadn't retained.so i'm going straight to the source- the battle of troy, 2700 years of accumulated rage and blood and wisdom...and luckily i found the translator who can make it happen (for me, at least). fagles. fagles! his \"orestia\" rocked my world and now he's the go-to guy for all things classical. i wish i were smart and worldly enough to get a comparison of translations under way but i'm doing all i can to take on the challenge the iliad is throwing down.glad to say that at around book 5 the confusion is a presence, but not a hinderance. it's fucking death metal. compulsively readable, incredibly gutsy and frank and vivid. there's a humanity here which really does shine through all the blood grudges and slaughter and dick-waving and general bellicosity, as a lot of other reviewers have pointed out. people start fights, rend flesh, and either cry to their mamas materializing out of the sea (!?) or are whisked away in the nick of time by generous goddesses. men die for their comerades, beg favor from the gods who are in the midst of a honeymooners row the likes of which are no man's buisness. the gods feel pain, but they do not die...***finished! stayed up (almost) all night to cap it off at last! no sense in trying to communicate the breadth and density and power of the text, so i'll just post some of my favorite quotes in due time (i.e. when and if i get around to it).   \n",
       "104428  yt video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvv2w1...this is my third pass at the beginning text of western literature. from fitzgerald to fagles, and now to lattimore, aided with the greek text from loeb library, i've both savored the richness of the homeric greek and recoiled at the graphic, violent intensity of its content. in one sense, this is the blueprint for all country music: a man loses his girlfriend, stops working, sulks, and then his best friend dies. in another sense it is a narrative onslaught that foregrounds a panorama of mythological history (for the genesis of which we must turn to hesiod).it must be noted that the work represents a much greater complexity than mainstream academia would have us believe. it is not simply what its opening lines tell us; it isn't merely the muses' account, via homer, of achilles' wrath (μῆνῐς) and its destruction. in fact there is very much within the novel that supersedes the wrath, which counterbalances the power of his wrath to transcend even destinies decreed by the immortals (an interesting suspension of the determinism that underpins the whole framework). like the torah (or even milton's retelling of the pentateuch), it is too simplifying to say that it is a \"song\" of man's disobedience. after all, there was a great deal of destruction already inherent in the fruit.homer has (anachronistically) confirmed hippocrates's aphorism that life is short but art is long. over two millennia later, the great lover of books and wine, clifton fadiman, placed the iliad at the start of his \\nthe new lifetime reading plan: the classic guide to world literature, revised and expanded\\n. of it and the odyssey, he says, \"they are the first as well as the greatest epics of our civilization\"; \"achilles is the first hero in western literature; and ever since, when we talk of heroic qualities, achilles is somewhere in the back of our minds...\"; \"the essential quality of the iliad is nobility\"; and, finally, \"all imaginative artists, but only if they are great enough, seem contemporaries [of homer].\" others have noted some points of intrigue: richard jenkyn's, in \\nclassical literature\\n, states, \"the iliad is a story without villains...\" and \"homer...has shaped a distinctive picture of the divine.\" robert b. downs, in \\nbooks that changed the world\\n, declared, \"...homer's epic creations...established for all time the greatness of greek literature.\" harold bloom affirms the greatness in his introduction to his eponymous compendium of critical essays: \"the iliad, except for the yahwist, dante, and shakespeare, is the most extraordinary writing yet to come out of the west....\" simone weil, a lover of the iliad, declares force as the true center of the epic, in her monumental essay \"the iliad, or the poem of force.\" and finally: the renowned scholar alberto manguel, in his \"biography\" of homer's epics, quotes raymond queneau: \"every great work of literature is either the iliad or the odyssey.\"in his remarkable \"visual essay,\" \\nthe infinity of lists\\n, the late umberto eco uses the shield of achilles (from book xviii) to describe a closed form. this is because homer is fully engaged in the whole of his cultural milieu: its social norms and mores, its philosophy, its history (myth), its values. he effortlessly spins his yarn with a nearly complete catalogue of characters both mortal and immortal (and, in achilles's case, in between). in the event that he needs a little help, the muses are his google (but not really, as we know). homer is in touch with every emotion and in every context, as if he himself has been a warrior, a lover, a peasant, a king, even an enslaved woman toiling at the distaff. the encyclopedic sweep of his efforts died out in the form of epic poetry (milton is perhaps the swan song of the form, and poe drove in the nail in his essay \"the poetic principle\"), but it has resurfaced in the last half century or so with books like pynchon's \\ngravity's rainbow\\n and david foster wallace's \\ninfinite jest\\n. the impulse to distill the whole of life, to trap within amber the collective consciousness of an era, has had conflagrations in europe and the americas (bolaño roberto being a chief example from south america), as expertly traced out in \\nthe maximalist novel: from thomas pynchon's gravity's rainbow to roberto bolano's 2666\\n. in a real sense, homer's epics, supplemented with hesiod on one side of history and the greek tragedians on the other, was the bible (biblion) for the greek peoples. so much so, that, even in the days of the early christian church, we see the people reacting to paul and barnabas like characters out of homer:and when the crowds saw what paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in lycaonian, “the gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!” barnabas they called zeus, and paul, hermes, because he was the chief speaker. and the priest of zeus, whose temple was at the entrance to the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates and wanted to offer sacrifice with the crowds. (acts 14:11-13, esv)one of the major focuses of the text is that of honor and nobility, what makes a man's life glorious. in the iliad the answer appears to be found through the fire of warfare. in other words, the greatest warrior is the most noble person. achilles on the achaian side and hektor on the torjan side represent the ideals of ancient greek eugenics. they are great and respected because they are powerful in battle. the intellect is represented in odysseus and nestor, but, in the heat of a skirmish, intellect is suspended in favor of blood lust. it is ironic, then, that helen should be the epicenter of the ten-year ware. like achilles, her stage time is minimal. homer does not litter the narratives of the battles with reminders of helen as the object of the opposition. though this started the war, it recedes to the background and the two-layer chess match--a dramatic, soap opera-like interweaving of mortals and immortals and their respective power politics--takes precedence.a feminist reading must be mentioned. yes, to a large degree, homer's epics cast women in a light that is far less than savory. brisies, for example, and helen herself, can definitely be chalked up to nothing more than war booty (forgive the pun). yet, we also cannot bury our heads in the sand and deny (or rewrite) history. to take weil's perspective, this is a culture of force: force, aggression, violence wins. unfortunately for women of the time, this is apparently the recipe for happiness in a greek man: \"when a man has been well filled with wine and with eating / and then does battle all day long against the enemy, / why, then the heart inside him is full of cheer....\" no mention of sex! notice, too, how aphrodite acts to bring helen and paris to bed together in book iii; and how hera colludes with aphrodite (among others) to bed/distract zeus in book xiv (i also cannot help but note here how zeus prefaces their intimate encounter with a list of all his philandering--how foreign to our sentiments!). i'm afraid that the sexual politics here, and especially in terms of gender, are a bit more complex than an immature reading of the narrative yields. i will avoid the concept of willingness, because i don't think we can debate that with the mindset of a homer or contemporary; we can only approach this with damaging revisionist presentism. i will, instead, end this shaky discussion of gender with a thought i had: with such vivid, visceral details of violence, why is there such reticence when it comes to sex? when it comes to warfare, we get this level of detail:this man peneleos caught underneath the brow, at the basesof the eye, and pushed the eyeball out, and the spear went clean throughthe eye-socket and tendon of the neck, so that he went downbackward, reaching out both hands, but peneleos drawinghis sharp sword hewed at the neck in the middle, and so dashed downwardthe head, with helm upon it, while still on the point of the big spearthe eyeball stuck.(book xiv, 493-499)oh, my zeus! but when it comes to sex, the most detail we get is they \"lay in love\" or paris's invitation to helen to \"go to bed and turn to lovemaking.\" one is tempted to reason that, given a culture devoid of judeo-christian morals, for example, such blatant omission of sexual conquest seems unexpected. when we think of ancient greek and trojan warriors, we think of primitive brutes plundering cities and ravaging women. yet we only see one side of this in the authoritative reporter of the culture. in an aesthetic sense, it is historically very difficult to describe sex in writing without the narrative collapsing (not everyone is an ovid). this has led to such treasures as literary review's annual bad sex in fiction award. but i hesitate to think that homer had this in mind. i am left to take a clue from helen's expression of embarrassment when zeus wants to have sex with her on high where all the others can see (to be sure, he doesn't choose this deliberately; he is just urgent under her spell), and zeus's acquiescence and gesture to wrap them in a golden cloud. like most preconceptions we have of homer, i think a closer reading will lead to a deeper view of what is really being said (or not said). this is not to excuse waspy values; only to rescue a great work from sophomoric thin-slicing.in the end, i am more of a longinian reader. that is, i hunt for the sublime in literature above the fracturing avenues of literary theory (o, how i wish i could pursue my master's degree over again!). for me, the most sublime moment comes in book ix. this book is a close formal relative of the \\nthe book of job\\n, in that three friends of achilles take turns trying to counsel and sway him in the midst of his lowest season in life (though job's is admittedly worse). in this midst of these speeches and achilles's rejoinders, we get this:i carry two sorts of destiny toward the day of my death. eitherif i stay here and fight b...   \n",

enough missions to go home. the problem is, you cannot go home. you cannot go home unless someone certifies you that you are insane. so you decide to pretend you're insane. will you go home now? nope, because if you decide to pretend you're insane, then that is proof enough that you are not insane, and therefore can still be sent to missions. that's the premise of this awesome novel by joseph heller, catch-22. it is absurdist literature at its finest, and i am thankful to my sister for recommending this one to me. if she hadn't lent it to me, then i probably would not have read it. the thing is, this is a very good example of absurdist literature, and it gains plenty of points for language, in my book. there are plenty of non-sequiturs, and the dialog is just hilarious, as well as the logic that is described. i often found myself laughing by myself, embarrassing myself as i was reading this. that being said, this book also made me think. the narrative is non-linear; every chapter is centered on a particular character, and the temporal dimension of every chapter is different. it is linear within each chapter, but the beginning of one chapter does not mean it starts at the end of the previous one. hence, the grand big picture is slowly being shaped as the reader gets to know more of each character. slowly, one by one, the characters die. but before they do, each character seems to have a particular quirk, a personality, and that i definitely liked. as much as it is an absurdist narrative, i didn't find myself annoyed or irritated, unlike my reading experiences with gary shteyngart's absurdistan, or ferenc karinthy's metropole. somehow, i didn't get tired of the funny comic devices that heller used in catch-22. so yes, i definitely recommend this book. it is hilarious, a great read, and something that in my opinion, would be considered a classic piece of literature a few decades from now. i give it 5 out of 5 stars.see my other book reviews

not really. i didn't even pretend to myself. it was a chore and oliver wasn't someone that i wanted to carry on with for the whole journey. luckily, the high school english teacher decided what the dickens did we need to read dickens anyway and assigned us the outsiders the film (showed me to read on my own). i was all set to write my awesome book report based on:i never finished reading oliver twist. i gave up in *coughs* 1994 and never went back to it. was i intending to go back to it?

i'm glad to be too old to like him now but not old enough to have liked him the first time around). (uncle phil collins, however, had my 30th birthday marked off on his calendar.) this toothless old guy makes the boys (and bitches. this isn't a gay version) steal for him. there was nothing homoerotic or sinister about any of it. what the hell? not even when oliver steals sausages.right...[i read all of the classics 'cause they were cheap in paperback. pretty much no other reason than that. at least no other reason why classics over any other type of book.]i also gave up on david copperfield. it's not a coincidence that my fickleness kicked in right around the time his titular (testicular) leads dropped their testes (told ya). i couldn't take the wide-eyed shit. the books were too long. i hated the pedestal women in their lives. yeah, there is good stuff inside. but dickens can be such a dick! 'a christmas story' had freaking cool ideas (the ghosts of the past, present and future). great expectations was haunting. trapping yourself in your own twist desires, becoming a ghost before your time. he suffered from having to stretch out his works over time for money. much like tv shows that jump the shark these days, probably. but why did he have to tack on the sop? i know there was a darker eye in there, somewhere. one little orphan didn't change anybody. people are not waiting to be picked up and set on pedestals to redeem all. that especially bugged me about the women when i was young. you'd think a man who was born in a prison would know that about different sides. didn't he meet all types of women in the different circles he moved in?you pick yourself up out of the dirt, if you can, and try and forget the taste of it in your mouth. mother/whore complexes? shit. i liked all of the stuff about wolves in sheeps clothing in wolves clothing in sheeps clothing. that was the best part of the part of oliver twist that i read.okay, what really happened is that i threw the book down and cried out something like: \"is this never gonna end? i didn't get my panties in a twist over charles dickens' pity party that was oliver! twist! the party part was missing. jesus should show up to be savior and turn all the water into wine. or the inmates could make some hooch. just saying...yeah, the sob story part annoyed me too. i wasn't lying about all that. i'm just trying to sound smarter over the being bored stuff. (maybe i should play up on the whole \"fourteen\" part of the story.)i was all set to post a photo of the chef boyardee oliver twist advertisement, but i couldn't find it! not fair!here's a photo from the david lean adaptation. i love david lean.when my mama made me be her slave (think shirley jackson. the film version starring vincent price), i'd make her do the oliver! \"please sir, may i have some more?\" before i'd go cook her dinner. it was always \"whatever you wanna fix\" for us. child abuse stinks. dickens knew it. i knew it.we was beat before we was born!i did love bleak house and our mutual friend. it's not all dickens, just little orphan chuckie.p.s. on lost, the annoying english guy carries around an unread copy of our mutual friend. he's read them all in order and is saving the last one for before he dies (hope he never got to read it. i gave up on lost). i know that this was done somewhere else, i just can't remember where it was from. the same exact thing about carrying around our mutual friend. anyone got a better memory than me? (hope it's not from something totally embarrassing. i'll scratch my head over who an actor is. after consulting the imdb, i'll turn red because they were from a canadian teen show. \"i was uh... wrong...i've never seen that boy before in my life!\")p.s.s. in no way is david simon like charles dickens. the wire, like dickens, was interested in how institutions fuck with people. okay, that one way. but still! david simon never resorted to sop. the good things that happened happened along with the bad, not changing everything. the way that the bad shit is like a ghost coming back to haunt you as it will, or living behind a wall of sick feeling of memories. the good is the fresh air you sometimes get to breathe before it starts to stink again. memories suck. no wonder dickens wrote so many autobiographical ones to pretend there was ever gonna be any fresher air.   \n",

                                                   some of you may ask \"what were you thinking, mizuki? why did you give the bell jar only two stars? isn't this book like, a classic?\"i am aware of the fact that sylvia plath is a famous poet and the bell jar is considered a classic, and i do agree that the writing is poetic and beautiful, the story is also very honest and realistic as well. in fact, plath's writing and the first half of the book deserve four full stars; but sadly...everything took a nosedive when the heroine suffers a mental breakdown with depression.here're a few things i'd like to clarify:(1) i understand how sucky and painful it is for a person to suffer depression and become mentally ill. (2) i understand how depressing it is to lose the scholarship you had dreamed of for the longest of time and realize that you are in fact not as special and extraordinary as you had always believed yourself to be.(3) i understand how depressing and suppressing it is for young women of the 1950s to have no way out aside from getting married, having kids and being housewives.(4) i do feel sorry that the main character embarrassed herself in new york when she was surrounded by people from the ny fashion scene and she didn't have a clue about how she was supposed to behave around people from the well respected circles. no one should be humiliated like this.(5) i do feel bad that the mc was later assaulted and beat by a guy, it's a horrible experience. but strangely enough, the mc seemed to burst this experience aside without further mention, whilst she kept moaning and whining about minor things.still all the great writing and my understanding cannot cover for the insufferable main character, her constant whining and moaning, her complaining about everything and everyone around her.if the bell jar is a young adult novel, i would have long called the mc out on being such an ungrateful spoiled brat. my stomach was turning over and over with distaste when i read that the mc's mother single-handedly raised her daughter after her husband passing away, still the mc hated her mother. nothing the mother did and said could please her, nothing.let's give you one more example:the mc's mother went to the asylum to visit her daughter, she brought her roses because it was her birthday; the mother kept begging her daughter to tell her what she had done so wrong in her childhood which caused her to end up in an asylum. the mc's reaction to this is: \"i hate her.\"bitch, please.i'm not saying the mc's mother is the perfect mom, she had her own shortcoming and she doesn't seem to understand what's going on in her daughter's mind. but hey, if you had to insist on hating your mother so much, at least give me some reasons, some explanation, some examples to see why your hatred is justified. damn it!not to mention said mc also thought poorly of her female companies/friends and her suitor. in her eyes, those who were in the same age group with her were all boring, shallow, stupid and inferior than her, and god forbid that those girls she met in new york be richer and more worldly than her! it's just unacceptable! don't get me wrong, many of these girls are in fact vain and unlikable, but it doesn't look like they are all out to get the mc's blood. for god's sake!the great writing also cannot cover for the author's fault in engaging her main character with the readers. as beautiful the writing is and as realistic, vividly written and interesting the story (especially the mc's job in new york and the vanity of the ny fashion scene) is, i still cannot overlook the lack of feeling in the writing and the lack of reasons and explanation beyond characters' personalities and actions. for example, can we manage to see the reason why the mc hated her mother so very much? nap.i do think it's a painfully honest and realistically, poetically written book, the feeling of pain, emptiness and alienation is beautifully expressed through the writing; and i suspect something has been lost in translation (i read the chinese version of the book), but in the end i'm still disappointed, i especially don't enjoy how the story goes once the mc got a mental breakdown, after the breakdown, the bell jar loses much of its charm in my eyes and things get very, very sandy and boring. what a pity.plus i honestly don't feel very sympathetic after finished reading the mc's story. her story to me is more like a story about a girl who thinks she's so special because she's such a straight-a ideal student and she's so much smarter and better than anyone her age; but then she goes to new york and realizes she isn't so very special because there are larger fishes in the sea and she meets a bunch of girls who are all from much richer families than hers. her self-confidence goes to the toilet and eventually she gets a mental breakdown because she's so unhappy with her life. full stop.it's not a ya, but sadly the story and its mc made me feel like i'm reading one.   \n",
       "107050  i know, i know what you must be thinking. such a low grade for the bell jar? isn’t this the holy grail of feminism? isn’t it considered a classic? it might be considered a classic, but in my opinion, it is not deserving of that title. my experience of reading it lead me to conclude that it lacks depth. that might not be your experience but in my view, this chaotical and illogical narrative featuring a protagonist that isn’t exactly sympathetic, doesn’t have much going for it. moreover, i think sylvia must have been at least slightly embarrassed of it herself, that is why she allegedly published it under a pseudonym. plath wanted it to be distinct from her other more serious (and in my view, much better) writing and she reportedly referred to this novel as a potboiler- something that addressed the popular tastes of the day. she wanted to create something that would sell. in her journal, she wrote how there is a real market for literature focusing on hospital and mental illnesses and that she was a fool if she didn't take advantage of it (i.e. use her own personal experiences to write the novel). this lead to her writing this semi-autobiographical novel, which she according to her husband, wrote fairly quickly. she found a british published sooner than an american one. one editor wrote to her: “we didn’t feel that you had managed to use your materials successfully in a novelistic way.” that’s exactly my opinion as well. on the other hand, in one letter to her mother, plath wrote that she needed to write this novel to get over her past experiences. that might be additional motivation, but if it was therapeutic for plath (which i doubt because she killed herself shortly after), it doesn't mean it will be therapeutical for the reader.the bell jar doesn’t feel like a novel. i had to do a lot of research to make myself believe that it was actually published prior to her death. i was so sure that it was an unfinished novel, that it was published by mistake- even after reading otherwise. but no, sylvia did see this novel published in uk, she just didn’t deem it worthy of her name. rightly so, i might add, for she was so much better than this novel, capable of writing much better. my initial thoughts were that the only reason why she has written a novel of such a poor quality was that she was mentally ill when she was writing it. then i remembered that she wrote most of her poetry while she was depressed but her poetry is exceptional nevertheless. she was obviously capable of writing well even while she was depressed. now, that i know that she probably wrote it for financial reasons, i understand some things better. i still think we shouldn’t appreciate her poetry less on account of this poorly written novel. whatever were her reasons for writing it, i will continue to see this novel separately from her powerful poems and will never think less of them.the autobiographical aspect of the bell jarthere are many autobiographical elements in the bell jar (plath even included entire episodes from her own life- google it if you want to know exactly how and where) but somehow they don’t make the novel seem more real. the narrative is told from a point of view of esther, a young (supposedly brilliant- though this is not exactly manifested in the novel) woman. the novel opens with esther’s trip to new york and is based on plath’s personal experience as a guest editor of mademoiselle. anyhow, the character of esther goodwood find herself somewhat at crossroads. she is not sure what she will do with herself. being an accomplished student, miss greenwood always imagined an amazing future for herself but now she is not so sure. i do think that first part of the novel had potential and it is something that many people can relate to- that feeling when you’re leaving university and you have no idea what life installs for you. what was odd, however, was the way that esther seems to observe other young ladies who try to befriend her (for example doreen) from some distance. i found it very hard to relate to esther on account of this. for example, her friend doreen appears at esther’s door but esther closes down the door on her, leaving her to vomit on the hallway and is glad when she is gone by the morning. shortly after, doreen experienced food poisoning and enjoy is because she likes other people (doreen included) to fuss over her and take care of her. perhaps because this esther’s the best chance at intimacy and the only time when esther is not able to puss other away. the second part of the novel, one that describes her breakdown and treatment is also founded on plath’s personal experiences. somewhere along the way, her psychiatric treatment begins. this novel is considered a critique of a patriarchal society and also a warning against bad treatment of women in psychiatric institutions. why i can see certainly see why these themes are important, i can't say that the novel addressed them in the right way. i will explain what my problem with this novel is as soon as i include this spoiler alert. spoiler alertthis part of review is infested with spoilers, so do skip it if you didn’t read this one. i don’t go into details about the plot (not that there is much of a plot anyway) but i shall reference events that have occurred in different stages of the novel, so if you want to dive in not knowing anything- skip this part!my problem with the bell jar here is my problem with the bell jar. we have a protagonist who is completely self- obsessed to the point it is sickening and frankly it seems to border with sociopath behaviour. esther moans and moans about everything. her narrative is a succession of never ending complaints. she hates everyone and everything. apparently, nobody is good enough for her. oddly enough, that’s not even the worst part of the novel. as irritating as that might have been, it could have been overlooked if there wasn’t for something else, something much more sinister.do you know what scares me the most? esther’s attitude towards other women. no, it is not her shyness that is keeping her away from establishing something that would even remotely resemble a friendly relationship with other women. it is her negative view of women. i didn’t notice that esther had some speech defect or social anxiety that would prevent from communicating with her own gender, she is, for example, very eloquent when it comes to deceiving her professors so that she wouldn’t have to study for a class she hates. when it benefits her, she can be eloquent, so i don’t think that she can get away with an excuse of being an introvert/shy. if there is a woman esther likes, she must be some poetess dead for centuries, at any rate no women living in her present time is worthy of her attention or god forbid friendship. god forbit that esther feels any sympathy for any other women or even considers her worthy of a thought. patriarchal society is the devil. women? they’re a step lower than that, something so lowly that it doesn’t even deserve a name. with the exception of esther, she is the best thing that has ever happened to this world, but we faulty humans, fail to grasp her greatness. how will she ever punish us? why, by taking herself away from us. goodbye, cruel world, i was always too grand for you.let’s look at esther’s life for a second. she was raised by a single mother who in the course of this novel acts very lovingly towards her. yes, she tries to make her think about practical things- but what women doesn’t do that? ester hates her mother and enjoys making her life’s miserable. why? ok, let’s that one slip. is there a single female character in this whole novel that esther cares about? forget that. is there any character of any gender that she cares about (expect herself)? does she ever stop to wonder how someone else might feel? does she care about others? is she ever emphatic? this book makes me sad but it was not esther i felt for, but those around her. i only felt sad in a general way, because the bad treatment of mental patients would make everyone feel down. mostly, i felt sad because i know that there are women like esther. women making things hard for other women. women making other women feel bad about the fact they are- women. women criticizing other women nonstop. women who deep inside hate themselves because they are- women. i’ve felt this attitude many times, usually i just ignore such women and focus my attention on all those smart, intelligent and amazing women in this world- and there are plenty of those. don’t let anyone try to convince otherwise. i don’t think it is normal to be an adult woman and dislike every single person of your own gender that you come across with. it is not like she came across any really bad women. some weren’t the brightest, and esther much enjoyed making fun of those, but did any actually tried to harm her? somebody expected her to make a summer job because she was a student? how dare they! basters?! esther is all that, she is incredibly intelligent and she can’t possibly degrade herself with a summer job, better to refuse to wash her hair – that will teach a patriarchal society a lesson. was there a single woman in this novel that tried to do her serious harm? weren’t many of them in fact friendly? it is not really fair to see them as lower beings just because they are not (or so we're made to think) as smart as esther.esther vs. everyone as for esther’s finance buddy, i’m sorry but didn’t she chose him herself? didn’t she feel smug about it? didn’t she feel that she finally belongs to society now, didn’t she felt more accept among other students because she had a serious boyfriend? just like the protagonist of the catcher in the rye esther desperately wants to belong to the society but at the same time she detests it. she wants to be able to look everyone from above, but she also wants to feel loved and accepted. she is like those poor people who talk endlessly about the corruption of the wealt...   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                it's the easiest thing to describe war and peace with a lot of grandiose nothing statements. like this one they got on the back, \"if life could write, it would write like tolstoy.\" and when you're reading it it really tends to feel like these abstract notions. i found myself thinking that instead of connecting to it on a personal level the way novels tend to be a one on one interaction between another mind and yours, this felt like collectively participating in or witnessing something that's both old and continuous, like seeing the pyramids in person. these ideas that end up seeming silly and overly reverent in retrospect just spill out on their own. it could be cultural, the fact that you don't need to have read it or even read in general to still recognize it as one of the great works of literature. so it could be hype, which again is silly and arbitrary. on the other hand the actual work, the words on the page, is so original it seems like billing it as a \"classic\" distracts from how experimental a work it truly is. you can take tolstoy's word for it that it's not a novel, it doesn't have the kind of structure of something like anna karenina. the parts that make it up, the romance, the class commentary, the family drama, the war narrative, the historical documentation, the philosophical commentary, all these pieces succeed well enough on their own that some individual chapters could work as short stories, and yet they all work fantastic in concert with one another. and that's part of tolstoy's grand project with this thing, to critique our basic views of history and life by offering up patterns and connections between these seemingly unconnected aspects. tolstoy's is set apart from others who do similar ideas by tying this in to his religious viewpoints and his humanistic ideas.so as tempted as you may be to say, \"a man didn't write this; life wrote this,\" it's still deeply entrenched in tolstoy's very individual ideas, and in fact that's the reason it exists as the original work it is. tolstoy's literary genius is his ability to do full justice to the thoughts, feelings, and words of people who are not him. tolstoy's not quite a nationalist, but there are so many characters that are and get glittery eyes when senpai emperor notices them, that someone who's not paying attention could call the novel nationalistic. and though napoleon is a mustache twirling villain in this thing, he gets treated with far more examination than, say, the embarrassing strawman portrayal of joan of arc in henry vi, part 1. tolstoy definitely puts him through the grinder and berates the historians for ever venerating him, but it's done with thoughtful nuance.ultimately, the things that hooked me while reading (which run contrary to how i tend to approach novels) are the basic narrative and character stuff. tolstoy's the farthest thing from subtle (window open to the west, napoleon's coming from the west, wow bravo leo) but he doesn't need to be that subtle because he puts everything out there and still makes it work. it's incredibly accessible, just intimidating cause of the physical heft of it. you could not give a damn about history or the problem of induction and still get carried by everyone's troubles and triumphs and their intersecting arcs. i didn't even know that much about the time period and napoleon's wars and i kept up just fine, picking up some knowledge along the way. the book is enjoyable and impressive, and you should read it not to have read it and mark it off a list, but because you're bound to be taken by something in it. strong recommendation.   \n",

   i decided to read this while staying in dorchester, england -- the real-life town of hardy's casterbridge. on the extensive walking tour we took of the town our guide repeatedly referred to hardy's works and i (despite four years as an undergrad english major) was embarrassed to admit that my only previous experience with the writer was a second-rate short story, (\"the three strangers,\") i assigned several years ago in a high school british lit elective course. if i were an undergraduate again i would love to go back and deconstruct the novel, processing it through the lens of feminist criticism. since i'm not (and i have so many other books to read this summer) i have to be satisfied with reading margaret r. higonnet's excellent introduction. (the penguin classics edition is worth every penny for it and for the extensive appendices and notes section.)reading tess in the era of #metoo creates significant but beneficial discomfort. despite hardy's portrayal of tess as victim of the sexual assault that shapes her youth, in the end tess regains control of her life. as higonnet notes, \"with the simple phrase 'i am ready', [tess] gathers the strands of her life together.\" i'm glad i took the time to (re)discover hardy. his landscapes were new to me; unfortunately the portrayal of his male characters' treatment of women is sadly still all too familiar.    \n",
       "109658  http://notesfromzembla.wordpress.com/...adame bovary was one described by vladimir nabokov’s father as “the unsurpassed pearl of french literature”; nabokov felt the judgement still stood when he was writing his memoir ‘speak, memory’ and indeed the judgement still stands today. madame bovary remains the most modern of all classic novels, it’s themes of adultery, sexual freedom and consumerism resonate more deeply today when it was written, its story would not look out of place in a modern day soap opera or romance novel, in many ways madame bovary was the first romance novel, yet flaubert was able to elevate madame bovary beyond the copulation of cliché’s typical of most romance novels, as it rises as beautiful and translucent as the skin of its heroine against the red sheets where her lover, leon gazes at her admiringly, to become one of the greatest works of art and literature of all time.the novel begins with the introduction of charles bovary and his grotesque and bizarre hat, as he makes a rather bad impression on his new class mates on his first day at school; “it was one of those composite hats, where you find traces of the bearskin, shako, derby, sealskin cap, and cotton nightcap; in short, one of those wretched things whose dumb ugliness has depths of expression like an imbecile’s face. oval, stiffened with whalebone, it began with three round lumps; then alternating lozenge-shaped patches of velvet and rabbit skin separated by a red band; after that came a sort of bag that ended in a cardboard polygon covered with complicated braiding, from which hung, at the end of a long thin cord, small twisted gold threads in the form of a tassel. the cap was new; its peak shone” in this novel we soon become accustomed to the fact that objects are almost secondary characters in and of themselves, they function as extensions of the character associated with them. thus charles’s hat creates an image of him in our minds of incompetence, awkwardness even ugliness, a grotesque and pathetic figure, a wretched person whose imbecility is perfectly matched in his headgear.the unnamed narrator then further expands on charles’s life and character. he is the product of an unhappy marriage, his father is nothing more than a rake and a boor, his mother is emotionally neurotic, a dreamy woman who pins all her hopes and dreams from a failed marriage and unhappy life on her son, charles. charles indeed seems to meander through life, after beginning his medical studies his mother sees him becoming a great and famous doctor: he fails his first medical exam, his mother blames the examiners, he passes second time and becomes and sets up a small practice in a small town named tostes, where his mother had been awaiting the death of an old doctor and had contrived via machiavellian means to marry him off to an ugly, old spinster who possesses a considerable fortune.thus we meet madame bovary the second, who acts as a kind of extension of madame bovary the first. “but his wife was master, she watched over his comings and goings…she had to have her cup of chocolate every morning. she complained incessantly of her nerves, of nerves, of depression and faintness. when people left her she couldn’t bear her loneliness…” charles has swapped one neurotic for another, the thought of visiting her cold bed at night, of being held in her bony arms fills him with disgust, his life again meanders mediocrely along until the arrival of a letter in the middle of night sealed with blue wax. (remember the colour, it will prove to be important.) it is a letter from a farmer named pierre rouault, who has broken his leg and requires urgent attention. image on his night-time journey to the farmer there is a beautiful description of the scenery, “the flat landscape stretched out as far as they eye could see, and the clumps of trees around the farmhouses showed up, at wide intervals, as patches of deep violet on that vast grey surface, which blurred at the horizon into the dullness of the sky” note the dull, yet serene atmosphere of the scene, as charles’s horse ambles towards his destination, the dullness is however punctuated by the deep violet of the farmhouses, notice also how charles is asleep on his horse but is constantly jolted awake by her and how charles’s mare takes fright as they enter the farm; plainly something momentous is about to take place in the slumbering life of charles. charles is greeted by the farmer’s daughter, emma, who is wearing a blue merino dress; noticeably a fire is blazing within the kitchen. whilst making pads for the bandages for pierre rouault’s leg, emma keeps on pricking her fingers, and somewhat suggestively, puts them to her full lips to suck them. charles’s gaze rests on her hands; “charles was surprised by the whiteness of her nails. they were lustrous, tapering, more highly polished than dieppe ivories and cut into almond shape. yet he hands were not beautiful, not white enough perhaps, and rather bony at the knuckles; they were also too long, with no softening curves.” if charles can be symbolised by his hat, then what do emma’s hands, hitherto the longest physical description in the book, say about her? superficially attractive perhaps, on first glance the lustre of her pale nails disguise the ugliness of her hands, which in comparison to the nails are dark and bony. charles’s gaze then rests on her eyes, which are truly beautiful, “though they were brown, they seemed to be black because of the lashes, and they met your gaze openly, with an artless candour.” again, emma’s eyes, though beautiful, are deceptive; her suggestiveness is again brought about by the frankness of her gaze. just before charles leaves he finds emma languorously gazing out the window, like the lonely heroine from a romance novel; they search for his riding crop and their bodies brush together, much to her embarrassment. charles continues to visit the rouault farm and continues to meet emma, “she always went with him as far as the doorstep. waiting for them to bring his horse, she stood there by him. they had said goodbye, they had no more to say; the fresh air wrapped all about her, fondling the stray locks of hair at the nape of her neck, or tugging on the strings of her apron around her hips, fluttering them like streamers. one day, when it was thawing, the trees in the yard were oozing damp from their bark; the snow on the top of the sheds was melting. she was at the door, she went to fetch her parasol, she opened it. the parasol, made of marbled silk, as the sun came shining through it, spread shifting colours over the whiteness of her face. there she was smiling in the moist warmth of its shade; and you could hear the drops of water, one by one, falling on the taut fabric.” again, charles sees emma both sensuously in the fondling her stray locks of hair, but also as a kind of romantic heroine, almost angelic, with the obscured light of her parasol resting on her face. indeed their mutual silence reads like a romantic scene when two lovers are so brimming with emotion that they cannot speak to one another, yet we get the feeling that flaubert is subverting the romantic genre as perhaps the characters have nothing to say to each other, not because of a common passion, but because they have nothing in common and so literally have nothing to talk about. (note also the awkwardness of their first conversation when emma complains about the dreariness of farm life.) charles’s wife, however, does not take kindly to him visiting the rouault farm after learning about the farmer’s attractive daughter and in a pique of jealousy she beans him from visiting them. not long after this, we discover that the fortune which charles married his wife for didn’t actually exist, much of it being a figment in her imagination, presumably in order to obtain a husband. charles’s parents are irate, and not long after this she has a heart attack. too late charles realises she loved him after all, though, interestingly he never stops referring to her as the widow dubuc, which was her name before she married him and became madame bovary, thus in charles’s mind she was never really madame bovary. one consolation from her death is that pierre rouault visits charles and invites him to visit the farm again, he tells him about how he felt when his wife passed away (who he actually did love) and how charles must take hope and plan for the future, it is spring after all. charles arrives at the farm; “through the cracks in the wood, the sun cast long narrow strips of brightness that broke across the angles of furniture and trembled on the ceiling. flies, on the table, were crawling up the glasses left there, and buzzing at the bottom, drowning in the cider dregs. the daylight that came down the chimney, turning the soot on the fire-back to velvet, touched the cold cinders blue. emma was sewing, she wore no fichu on her bare shoulders you could see bare drops of sweat.” again, we are reminded of charles’s first meeting with emma when he observes her sewing, again the observation is loaded with suggestiveness, charles imbues the sunlight on the ceiling with his emotion, is trembles, just as charles is trembling with excitement at seeing emma after several months and the soot in the fireplace is turned to velvet something ugly is transformed into something in a mirage of daylight, which is again linked to emma via the colour blue which was the colour of the seal of the letter which brought them together and the colour of emma’s dress when they first meet. we begin to see flaubert’s patterns emerge, as intricate and delicate as emma’s hair-do, but if soot seen as velvet symbolises emma, then we wonder what this says about her. imagecharles eventually proposes, via emma’s father, and is accepted. charles doesn’t shine very well at the wedding, being naturally shy, and morning after the wedding night it is as if he is the bride who has lost his virginity. somewhat ominously, after ...   \n",
       "111449  this is a great book, both as a thriller genre story that is exciting, and as a metafictional, literary, multi-layered classic exploring the bigger issues of being human.i've read this twice - this weekend and 40 years ago. it's the kind of book which is different every time you read it if you take a decade or two between readings. the first time for me was in the early 1970's. my thinking was black and white and i was marching for civil rights and against the vietnam war. i saw this book as one backing my beliefs that the establishment was evil since i was a radical leftist and i despised all adults over 30. i cried for mcmurphy and i blamed all real-life adults for being the same as nurse ratchet - pure evil - except for those adults who were leftists. adults stood for unjust and discriminatory law-and-order, which kept mainly rich white men wealthy and safe, while the rest of us, impoverished slaves and servants, had no rights. the strong against the weak, the rich against the poor, the privileged against the needy.it's 2012, and i see now the book is not as black and white as i thought. it's complex, nuanced, balanced and flawed. i've given it five stars because it's close to perfect in its structure, and it certainly is perfect in the exploration of the dual nature of people in general, that internal battle between our immature and destructive animal natures and our mostly equal desire for civilized, safe and dependable order. the head nurse is not evil, and mcmurphy is not a angelic righteous man. while the symbolism runs deep in the novel so that every main character represents an abstract facet of being human, the actual protagonists still read as very flesh and blood. it also is not a political book against being bourgeois, but rather, i think, a book that reluctantly acknowledges that for a healthy society both the impulses for ordinary self-control and lack of self-control are necessary for mental health. the drama takes place in a pressurized bottle, so the story is an overheated plot, but i think it is an accurate representation of the human impulses that swing real western societies back and forth between peaceful order and unsettling, disruptive, necessary change that often lead to progressive good.(view spoiler)[big nurse ratched is not the complete wretch and tyrant as i originally saw her, although without question her mania for procedure, control and power could easily have become terrible. but she wasn't insane, she had checks and balances on her authority and her methods did provide calm and repetitious days and peaceful sameness to the asylum's patients. a very restrictive homey, but sterile, family life, as it were. many found it helpful, which i missed in my first reading. the view of her as a ball-busting bitch came from some of the characters, but not all. i also missed the fact most of the inmates were not 'committed', so they were voluntarily under her care and could leave whenever they wanted. they were not unwilling captives, but genuinely fragile, mentally ill patients who had nothing to face the rigors of life. they needed to be in a mental hospital. the power she had over the schedule of their activities, which originally i thought of as horrific, i saw with this reading that in being mentally ill, the patients needed structure and no surprises, as well as a limited daily activity schedule. too many excitements and surprises did cause them much stress and harm. the real 'evil' of ratched rested in her power to shame the men. by a million small daily ways, she made them feel embarrassed and wretched to be themselves, magnifying their small, ordinary transgressions into horrific crimes. mcmurphy is the kind of guy most women would avoid. he was the male version of a ball buster, a cunt buster, if you will. he drank excessively, sought out bar fights, and was uneducated (although not illiterate). he had sex with a 15-year-old girl and he had been convicted of statutory rape. his first sexual intercourse was with a ten-year-old girl when he was nine. he won military awards serving in a war-time army, but got a dishonorable discharge. a woman looking for a good husband would not select him. on the other hand, he was a warm, friendly, honorable man who loved the mostly harmless side of youthful animal life - sex, drinking, partying, fishing, gambling. he was charismatic and a natural leader. for many of the male patients, because he was a man's man, and full of life, fun and vigor, they were able to trust him to a point and follow him which helped their self-confidence. he modeled male assertiveness and, most important for the patients, a complete lack of shame in his masculinity. he gave them the example of spitting in the eye of authority, a power which either they were unaware of or had too much fear of the consequences. and there were consequences.mcmurphy did not know he was a category of patient called 'committed'. he simply had not liked the prison where he was serving out a 6-month sentence. he faked being mentally ill in order to be moved to what he thought was a cushier imprisonment, and it was. he thought he was being clever gaming the system, and instead he discovered very late in his game that being 'committed' meant he could be locked up for life. under the 'committed' designation, he actually needed ratched's approval to be released. he also discovered that she had the authority to give him electric shock treatments, which scramble the brain's thoughts, or she could recommend to the supervisor the ultimate bad-behavior cure of a lobotomy if he broke enough rules to show the supervisor he was a danger to himself and others. to his regret, this was information about his commitment he uncovered late in the book.at first, he learned that a major part of ratched's job was to civilize the inmates into socially expected conformity and behavior. she had her own agenda of shaming them into the dirt, and he became determined to save the male patients from her authority. but as time passes, he learns the inmates really were limited by mental damage, as well as of ratched's considerable powers to punish. i missed the fact of the inmates genuine helplessness in society the first time i read this. i was reminded of the animal activists who released minks from a mink farm, only to have the consequence most of the minks died over a period of two weeks because they could not cope with their freedom.we see what occurs through the eyes of chief bromden, a 6'10\" native american who believes himself a weak midget. he sees schizophrenic imaginary images, but even now i'm uncertain if he was schizophrenic. he had a traumatic life of losses and the unmanning of his tribe, father and lifestyle, which in today's terms we'd call ptsd, and he served in a war-time army, plus the asylum had all of the patients under strong medications. he, i think, represents another older, conquered spent force of masculinity, a culture wiped out by modern western civilization. it's not unimportant that as a child bromden lives in a shack with his parents, his father a native american chief who fishes a river for salmon, and his mother a white woman, who convinces the tribe to sell out the property for money in order for white men to build an electricity-producing dam to stop the naturally flowing water and the fish and the life they enjoyed.through bromden's astute observations, the reader sees mcmurphy undergo a limited transformation when he understands what trouble he has caused himself by faking mental illness, and for awhile, he conforms. but it appears at a certain point, he refuses to continue conforming and reclaims his sense of who he is as a person. while mcmurphy sees himself as an untamed natural man and he is simply enjoying life, to the inmates, he is a masculine role model. to me, he is the literary force of male energy, yin, contending with the female force, yang, both forever fighting for supremacy within each of us whatever our sexual identity. ultimately, civilization wins because it is the strongest integrating force over all, but at the same time, the author, i think, shows that we need the yin/yang internal struggle of not conforming/conforming to become fully realized human beings. chief bromden recovers and escapes from the asylum and rejoins society, no longer emotionally stunted and crippled. but he is not a force of male nature as represented by the irresponsible peter pan man, mcmurphy, or the self-denying big nurse force of civilized-defined self-control. bromden is a whole integrated human being, cured, at the end.the ending, getting back to the book, is rushed. mcmurphy collapses too fast. however, given that he is drugged and undergoing est, given that bromden sees a few weeks before that mcmurphy himself realizes he's not going to win, ultimately it's close enough to believability. it always was a matter of who cracked first, and she had all the major weapons at her disposal. mcmurphy only had his self-love and irresponsible aggression. when a male patient dies because the two enemies interfere with with the geniune patient's fragile ability to survive, crushing him between their ideologies, it's the institution of civilized conformity that prevails. but the nurse is also impaired and crippled by the sudden experience of her own exposed fragility. she learns that the armor and protection of institutional conformity is an illusion maintained by the inmates respecting that paradigm of reality. in fact, conformity is a philosophy, given force only by the willingness of people to believe in it.  (hide spoiler)]my only quibble is the book most definitely comes off as anti-women, although how bad in that direction is arguable. most of classical literature and art uses the sexes to show opposing forces of nature: women are usually the force of simplicity, quiet maintenance of the status quo, creation, propagation or moral purity; men are symbolic usually of strength, power, authorit...   \n",

                                                                 this is a classic for a reason. excellently written. i was completely transported to 1600s salem.this audiobook production was particularly fantastic.summary (spoilers):a puritan minister stumbles on a bunch of young girls and a slave woman doing \"magic\" in the woods, and many of the girls fall sick afterwards, presumably of guilt and embarrassment for doing something so \"sinful.\" word spreads, and the townspeople start to describe it as witchcraft. under pressure, the girls admit to witchcraft and start accusing others in the town, which gives them a power they begin to enjoy. several innocent people are killed. the main secret that is revealed is that john proctor had an affair with young abigail williams, and she had done a spell in the woods to kill mrs. proctor so that john would be free to join abigail. however, john is regretful of the affair. he tries to be a voice of reason amongst all the witchcraft accusations, but is eventually accused himself. he first admits to witchcraft so that he can take care of his children after his wife hangs, but he changes his mind, and reveals his affair

that i was king and lord of all this country indefensibly, and had a right of possession; and if i could convey it, i might have it in inheritance as completely as any lord of a manor in england.”so, has the island got robinson, or has robinson got the island? this was one of the two questions i kept asking myself throughout the whole novel, the other being, whether defoe ever took the trouble to read over the first draught of his novel over in order to smooth out its rough edges and make it more palatable because there are quite some passages that stick out as badly written. however, these might be put down not so much to defoe as a writer but rather to his main character crusoe as a chronicler [1].it is quite strange that it took me 47 years before i took this classic tale in hand and read it from cover to cover, but then defoe himself was already in his 59th year when he wrote this book, which was his first novel ever. i expected a tale of adventure, but instead got a lecture on economics in that crusoe makes lists and calculations of everything, even of the cannibals he slays. to the last farthing, he lays open his business affairs, and there is thrift in whatever he does even before he lands on his island. for example, when in his first adventure, he manages to escape moorish slaveholders with the help of a little boy called xury, and is picked up by a portuguese ship, we get this:”he [i.e. the portuguese captain, t.s.] offered me also sixty pieces of eight more for my boy xury, which i was loth to take; not that i was unwilling to let the captain have him, but i was very loth to sell the poor boy’s liberty, who had assisted me so faithfully in procuring my own. however, when i let him know my reason, he owned it to be just, and offered me this medium, that he would give the boy an obligation to set him free in ten years, if he turned christian: upon this, and xury saying he was willing to go to him, i let the captain have him.”later, we are treated to lots of examples of how robinson crusoe, who is very lucky to procure material, powder, guns, seeds and other stuff from the stranded ship, improves his personal situation on the island. in order to economize on gunpowder, he catches, tames and breeds goats from which he derives a comfortable supply of ready meat and milk, and, prior to that, he also starts farming. a lot of the fascination of the book lies in witnessing the protagonist getting a comfortable life for himself through foresight, inventiveness and – what’ probably most important – tenacity. the latter is important in that he does not have all the tools he needs and so often has to help himself with the most primitive makeshift solutions, whose appliance to a task requires both patience and doggedness. crusoe’s readiness to exploit any opportunity with methodical determination –”i believe verily, had the calm weather held, i should have brought away the whole ship, piece by piece” –is the key to his survival, and probably also the main point defoe wants to make. james joyce sees in crusoe”the true prototype of th british colonist […]. the whole anglo-saxon spirit is in crusoe: the manly independence; the unconscious cruelty; the slow yet efficient intelligence; the sexual apathy; the practical, well-balanced religiousness; the calculating taciturnity”, and one feels inclined to agree with him in this: robinson crusoe is a manifest of middle-class capitalism, and would a tax advisor or an accounting clerk be cast away on a remote island, the result would probably be the same. the book’s down-to-earth, prosaic undercurrent can be seen quite early, in the father’s advice to his adventurous son:”he told me it was men of desperate fortunes on one hand, or of aspiring, superior fortunes on the other, who went abroad upon adventures, to rise by enterprise, and make themselves famous in undertakings of a nature out of the common road; that these things were all either too far above me or too far below me; that mine was the middle state, or what might be called the upper station of low life, which he had found, by long experience, was the best state in the world, the most suited to human happiness, not exposed to the miseries and hardships, the labour and sufferings of the mechanic part of mankind, and not embarrassed with the pride, luxury, ambition, and envy of the upper part of mankind. he told me i might judge of the happiness of this state by this one thing—viz. that this was the state of life which all other people envied; that kings have frequently lamented the miserable consequence of being born to great things, and wished they had been placed in the middle of the two extremes, between the mean and the great; that the wise man gave his testimony to this, as the standard of felicity, when he prayed to have neither poverty nor riches.”this may seem utterly boring and homespun, but i must confess that following crusoe in his solitary fight for survival, and his steady attempts at mastering an indifferent nature was extremely appealing to me. much more so than listening to my tax advisor. it may also be said that defoe is at his best as long as crusoe is on his own, trying to improve his dwelling, build a boat or plan his cultivation of the arable land he creates, while as soon as other people arrive on the scene, the writing gets incredibly dull, like a tax advisor’s might when he tries to write a play. practically all the other characters, with the exception of friday, remain nameless, and they are all, without an exception, anaemic and lifeless.it cannot be otherwise but that a man as much concerned with his own affairs – which is, to a certain extent quite understandable seeing that this man has stranded on an uninhabited island – will find to religion through the reflexion that whatever has happened to him has been ordained by god in order to make him realize the power and mercy his maker. it’s not a feeling of being overwhelmed by the vastness and bounty of creation that makes crusoe adopt a more zealous stance towards christianity but, like jonah, the conviction that whatever happened to him was a hint of god, who, for some reason or other, had got it into his head to make robinson crusoe from the city of york believe in him and adore him.one need not live on an island to be one, but it surely helps.[1] for example, we get a large part of the story told twice, once through the ex post report by robinson crusoe to his readers, and then in the form of the diary he kept on the island, which is also inserted in the report and gives an account of things that have already been covered in depth – and length. luckily for the reader, crusoe’s ink supplies ran out eventually, and he saw no way of making any more ink on his own. also, the end of the story – or the first part, because defoe also wrote a sequel – is maybe postponed a bit too much, for friday’s encounter with the bear is one of the least convincing incidents in the whole book and does not contribute to its main idea.   \n",

lolita when i read a clockwork orange. the primary male characters in both stories are repugnant and in both there are huge moral transgressions to be disgusted by. but yet both books are classics. with lolita it is the storytelling and the prose. in clockwork it is the alternative reality that anthony burgess creates, close enough to real life that it’s not really sci-fi. i should mention that his use of first person was dramatic. he makes heavy use of over two hundred (sometimes russian influenced) words that are either completely made up or borrowed directly such as devotchka for girl or rot for mouth. in doing so he creates a vibe to the book that is reminiscent of cyberpunk introduced some twenty years later in gibson’s necromancer. it is the murderous thug alex, the main character, and his band of misfits running around beating people to death and raping women that is so shocking. much of this happens early in the book so initially we don’t get to know the characters other than through this lens of violent behavior. but later we see alex abandoned by some of his minions and we see alex beaten often by the millicents (police) for reasons little better than his own rampages. there is at least a consistent thematic element to show alex doesn’t really get away with his transgressions at least in the cosmic order of things. in the intro, burgess said he wrote this book as titillation and is a little embarrassed by this being the work that he is most remembered by since he otherwise had a very productive and successful career as an author and screen play writer. in fact the version that i read had a very lengthy section of his accomplishments just to drive this point home.so is young alex rehabilitated? it depends somewhat on whether you read the british version and its twenty-one chapters or the american version, which the film was based on, and which lacks the final redeeming chapter. i can say that, for me, the significance of the redemption chapter in the british version did not play a critical role in how i view this book. i felt the final chapter a little shallow, consistent with much of the book. the intricacy of the plot or lack thereof, was not a differentiating point for me either. nonetheless there is a ton of genius in burgess’ approach here that makes this classic especially thought provoking.five stars with some reservations   \n",

                                                     i first read this several years ago, around 2003 i think, while i was living in japan. i remember really struggling to read the first chapter, which is the narrator's description and explanation of a character called robert cohn. i don't know why i had so much trouble reading it, just that i couldn't follow it, couldn't keep track of it. it wasn't a good way to start. then, i was hoping right up to the last page for a happy ending. i felt cheated that i didn't get it. kind of like \"why the hell did i read this then?\" this time around (reading it again for a book club - i missed the meeting, incidentally), because i knew what to expect, i could focus on all the other things in the novel, knowing that the narrator, jake, would still be alone at the end of it. that he wouldn't get to keep brett. and i had no trouble reading the first chapter. really, the prose is incredibly easy to read, simplistic even, except for when the descriptions get vague.but i'm getting ahead of myself.set in 1924, fiesta is the story of jake, an american living and working in paris, who goes to pamplona in spain to see the bull fighting with some friends, a mix of american and english ex-pats - one of which is brett, lady ashley, a beautiful and charismatic woman of 34 who's waiting for her divorce to come through so she can marry a bankrupt, mike campbell. jake and brett met during the war, when he was recovering from an injury. they fell in love, but his injury was of the groin variety so they can't be physically together - hence, she doesn't want to stay with him even though she loves him. instead, she has casual relationships and affairs, while jake has to watch. sometimes he even introduces them. but there's nothing he can do about it.the story is heavily detailed with the kind of descriptions that, while apparently perfectly acceptable in classics and other works of literature, can be the cause of some rather heavy criticism in genre fiction. like so:\"i unpacked my bags and stacked the books on the table beside the head of the bed, put out my shaving things, hung up some clothes in the big armoire, and made up a bundle for the laundry. then i took a shower in the bathroom and went down to lunch.\" (p.207)it would be petty of me to ask, where else would he take a shower? wouldn't it. shame.this book is all prose, very little plot. it's not that it's wordy, rather that it reads like a mouth full of crooked, over-crowded teeth. the dialogue is very 20s-specific, and if i was the kind of reviewer who liked to write snappy, witty, clever little reviews, the first thing i'd do is satirise the dialogue. like so:\"i feel so rotten!\" brett said.\"don't be a damned fool,\" jake said.\"the count's a brick.\"\"let's have a drink.\"\"here's the pub.\"\"this is a hell of a place,\" bill said.\"why don't you see when you're not wanted, cohn? go away. take that sad jewish face away,\" said mike.\"i feel like hell. don't let's talk,\" said brett.\"it's been damned hard on mike.\"\"do you still love me jake?\" asked brett.\"yes.\"\"because i'm a goner. i'm in love with the bullfighting boy.\"\"it's been damned hard on mike.\"\"where's that beer?\" mike asked.and so on. a lot of repetition, a lot of drunken mouthing off, a lot of really very pointless, empty conversation that goes round and round in circles. the problem is, of course, that the characters are all horrible, shallow, self-interested, boorish, ill-mannered, childish tourists, the kind that make you cringe. jake is probably the only character you can feel any real sympathy for, but even he has his moments. as the first-person narrator, it's amazing how little we know jake's thoughts. he hides behind recounting pointless dialogue and describing mundane things. there are times when he gets thoughtful, wistful even, and those parts are what make the novel worthwhile. it's also very easy to feel like you're in paris, and spain. the heavily descriptive prose does help create a realistic, breathing setting. especially when they reach pamplona, to watch the bull-fighting. it just also happens to be the place where their behaviour becomes even more embarrassing.i'm not sure if hemingway was criticising his fellow ex-pats or not - but i think he is. maybe he was just describing it how it was - and it is believable. jake isn't a judgemental character, but i wonder how much of that is jake and how much hemingway? this edition doesn't come with any additional notes or introductions or appendices, so i haven't read anything about the novel that might shed light on this. as a chronicle of ex-pat life, especially among those who have money, in the 20s, and of bull-fighting, it's a success. but it's still two-dimensional. as for the bull-fighting, it's one of the more interesting sections, especially towards the end where there's an involved recounting of three bull-fighters at work. we now know that bull's are red-green colour-blind; it's the movement of the cape that enrages them, not the colour. so i wonder what was wrong with the bull jake assumed was colour-blind?as simplistic as i've made this novel sound, there is quite a lot going on in the details, things that make it both interesting and deplorable. the bull fighting, for instance, is both a commemoration and a presentation of a highly controversial topic. there's certainly a parallel between the beauty and brutality of the bull-fighting, and the way these ex-pats treat each other. they are at once unlikeable, and likeable. it just goes to show how confounding humans can be, and how contradictory.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           the most difficult thing about reading fyodor dostoyevsky is pronouncing his name i think. the first dostoyevsky book i read was crime and punishment, i liked it well enough even though it was dark and sad and generally something of a downer. the brothers karamazov is also dark and sad yet there is an element of optimism in it. if you are attempting dostoyevsky for the first time crime and punishment is probably the easier option, being less dense, complex and simply shorter. actually having read these two books i believe dostoyevsky (translated) is not that hard to read, he was not one of those experimental postmodern authors that will have you scratching your head trying to decipher his prose and narrative structure. that said the brothers karamazov is a profound and psychologically complex novel, there are at least a couple of chapters which entirely consist of philosophical or even mystical digressions.at the most basic level the brothers karamazov is exactly what it says on tin, that is a story of brothers of the karamazov family. three of them (and possibly a bonus one). dmitri, the wild one who seems to specialize in digging his own grave, ivan the overthinking intellectual, and alyosha, the pious one. none of them were raised by their father fyodor pavlovich karamazov, who is clearly one of the all-time worst dads in fiction. the novel explores how such a shabby, unloving upbringing shape the three brothers in different ways.the narrative gradually transforms from a story of the development of the three brothers into a murder mystery followed by a courtroom drama. however, the intent is not to thrill but to explore the psychology of the main characters and the consequence of their actions. if this sounds like a drag i can assure you that it is not, most of the book is quite gripping and thought provoking. that said if you are looking for a thriller you would have to look elsewhere.the three brothers and practically all the characters in this book are very vividly drawn by dostoyevsky. i believe the most remarkable achievement is the characterization of alexei fyodorovich karamazov (a.k.a. alyosha) who is the heart and soul of the book. “nice” characters are very hard to write, especially as a protagonist, they tend to be less colorful than other characters and often downright bland. for example harry potter is hardly the most compelling character in the series named after him, his teachers, friends and enemies are much more interesting and fun to read about. dostoyevsky has somehow managed to make alyosha a complex, interesting and compelling in spite of not having a single mean bone in his body.the other two brothers are no less compelling. dimitri’s actions and eventual fate is a great illustration of what tend to happen when the head rules the heart, his wild “love crazed fool” behavior is often embarrassing undignified, and he ends up being something of a train wreck. ivan is intellectual to the point of pretentiousness, this also works out badly for him. alyosha, on the other hand, has an uncanny ability to shame the very worst people with his incorruptible goodness and extract goodness from them. there is also the dastardly yet pitiful smerdyakov who is probably an uncredited karamazov, he reminds me of dickens’ uriah heep (from [book; david copperfield]).the novel extols the value of honor, self-sacrifice, forgiveness and redemption, but above all love and understanding. i am certainly sold on these themes, by the time i finished the brothers karamazov i wanted to hug everybody.as usual for me with the classics, i “read” it on audiobook over several weeks (a couple of months with this one). also as usual, i am a total skinflint and opted for the free librivox version. this is book is read by quite a few volunteers, some are better than others but at least all of their reading is understandable. i you do not want to pay $20+ for an audible.com professional reading this is the way to go (there are of course other, rather nefarious ways to obtain audiobooks but i won’t mention those!).   \n",

                        i can't remember the last time i read a little princess by frances hodgson burnett, but i knew it's been a long time since i did so. it's one of the classics that i knew for sure i read multiple times and loved every single time i did. it wasn't until lately that i felt the need to read it again, perhaps to cleanse my palate from all the intense reads i've had lately.for those unfamiliar, a little princess is the story of sara crewe (no h in the book), the daughter of rich, doting father, captain crewe, who is sent to miss minchin's seminary for girls to study. miss minchin secretly thinks that sara is spoiled, despite her becoming the favorite pupil and classmate because of her intelligence and imagination. sara befriends most of the students but becomes especially close to slow and pudgy ermengarde, crybaby lottie and scullery maid becky. other students call her princess sara after news of her father's investment on diamond mines spread, and while this embarrasses her at first, sara learns to use this to remind herself to be compassionate to others.sara's lavish eleventh birthday party was abruptly put to a stop after the news of her father's death, leaving her orphaned and penniless, after his father's friend disappears with all their mone. miss minchin is forced to adopt her and she falls from being the show pupil to a drudge, helping becky out in the kitchen and in various errands around the school. sara makes use of her imagination, strength and compassion to get through the next three years as a servant, attempting to pretend her cold and hunger away, finding comfort from the few friends she had left, and doing her best to still act like a princess despite being a pauper.spoiler warning starts here.i realize as i re-read this classic that i knew the story almost by heart. i remember all the characters around sara -- ermengarde, lottie, becky, miss minchin, miss amelia, lavinia, even melchisedec the rat and emily the doll. my visualization of the characters are still the same as the cartoon, having watched them for years. there were a lot of differences from the cartoon and the book, of course, such as:1. one of sara's parties when lavinia scares her horse2. lavinia's birthday party3. peter, sara's horse guy, who becomes a chimney sweep and sara's attempt at being one4. sara spends the night in the stable5. the stable being on fire because of lottie upsetting her jack-o-lantern after she was scared by lavinia6. lavinia moving into sara's old room and requesting her to be her personal maidit kind of scares me that i remember so much detail in the old cartoon. but anyway, despite not having those juicier scenes, a little princess is still a beautiful classic story, one that every girl, no matter how old or young, should read. we could learn a lot from sara, most especially compassion for others even if they do not deserve it. her generosity is something to be admired, and the novel shows us that a little generosity can go a long way and can inspire other people to do the same (the particular scene where sara gave five loaves of bread to a street urchin when she was just as hungry was very heartwarming).when i was a kid, i used to wish i was princess sara because she was a pretty, well-liked girl, who manages to rise above her trials. now that i'm years older -- and hopefully, wiser -- i still want to be like princess sara, but not for the same reasons. i want to be as compassionate, as imaginative, and as resilient as sara crewe, and be a princess in the way she thought a girl should be. :)   \n",

                        such a wonderful book! rightfully called 'classic' and my review would never be able to do this book justice. first off, i was always embarrassed that i hadn't read this book before now, and second, i got it from the library and after having read, i think it's one that every book lover should own.this was such an honest and poignant story set in brooklyn, ny, beginning in the summer of 1912. we meet our main character, francie nolan, as well as her mother (katie), johnny (papa!) neeley (brother) and her loving aunts evy and sissy as well as other secondary characters along the way. it's a journey of the coming of age of a child as well as the trials and tribulations of growing up poor and everyone pulling together to do whatever necessary and make whatever sacrifices are necessary for survival. i really savored this story and although i had much less struggles growing up, it was definitely a story that made me remember the simpler times of childhood. one of the things that stuck with me most was that johnny was always loved and always remembered in the most positive way by katie, francie and neeley. i also loved the relationship between francie and neeley. although i was annoyed that katie obviously favored her son over her daughter, one of my favorite parts was pages 463 to 465 when katie and francie shared a true mother/daughter moment (view spoiler)[ when francie had her heart broken by lee  (hide spoiler)] this was one of those books when i hated to come to the end. a true classic, and it's about time that i got to it.    \n",

can't yell anywhere else...let's do a roast review because that is who i am. when in doubt...roast.meet i. our protagonist. also known as \"tenente\". hemingway assumes that his average american reader knows that this means \"lieutenant\" in italian. news flash: the average american reader is unaware of this fact, and thus i spent the first 100 pages of the book thinking that \"tenente\" was i's actual name. this is a technique that works in flash fiction, people. not in actual novels. cue the screaming. (also, this guy's name is \"federic henry\", which is apparently an american name, and from which one can also derive the nickname of \"fred\".) meet miss barkley (also known as catherine), our love interest. she was the angsty, insecure, clingy, codependent girlfriend before it was cool. the only problem, of course, is that there is absolutely 0 backstory to explain why she's like this, and we never get an explanation. i lies to her once, and as a result, she will never trust him again or something whaaaaaaa except that's never stated. it's just implied. like everything in this book.the other characters? who needs them? we've got rinaldi, easily the most entertaining character in the book--except that we don't really know anything about him. all we know is that he's the original sassy gay best friend. (or at least, i'm assuming he's gay. he spends the entire book calling \"i\" \"baby\" and asking him for kisses and this does not mean cheek kisses, y'all). except he's also very into women. so. is he bi? is he just really troubled? is this a really bad impression of italians? hemingway either: 1) doesn't know or 2) doesn't care.speaking of italians: hemingway informs us that \"i\" doesn't know how to spell in italian. this is a clever ruse to disguise the fact that hemingway himself doesn't know how to spell in italian. as someone who knows a bit of the language and definitely how to spell some of the common words, i cringed every time they spoke in italian. because. he mispelled \"hi\" in italian. how does one even do that. i know hemingway has been lauded as a brilliant writer and i know it's a different time period. i'm going to try not to bring fitzgerald into this review even though i could sing about how much i love fitzgerald's writing style for at least a year. the writing style sucks okay. it really does. it's flat and uninspired and this guy has no clue how to use commas or dialogue tags. so half the time i had no clue who was talking and i just skimmed conversations (which is fine, they're literally all extraneous) because i couldn't keep up. how does one get away with writing like that? howwww????!!!!!also, can i just mention: i had no idea that americans in the italian army were as rich as they were, or that they had to do as little fighting in world war one as this guy did, because he'd never been in combat before getting his leg badly injured, and i swear he had so much money he never needed to work another day in his life. his girlfriend really just stayed with him for the money, i think. he literally bought a cabin in the mountains in switzerland and drank to excess at swiss bars every single day and he never worked and never got paid. like...how.i could write an entire review about hemingway's characters' view of women, but for right now, let's just say: he writes women like they're the worst (probably because he only knew flappers and they were kind of troubled), and his male characters are so obsessed with women that i was embarrassed to the point of literal actual tears at one point. that's right, y'all. this book literally made me cry from anger. because these men...my goodness. the women are objects. we're at war so that we can sleep with all the girls who come along. these two innocent, small, helpless girls who need help escaping the german advance in italy? man, i wish we weren't so busy retreating...if we weren't heaven knows we'd be cheering our luck about finding a couple of virgins on the side of the road. (please note: these two girls were fourteen and fifteen.) also the romantic relationship was entirely built off codependency and cruelty and this is not love, people. it genuinely isn't. \"am i a good girl?\" \"please tell me i'm doing well. i just want to please you.\" \"the rain doesn't change how much you love me, does it?\" \"i'm so fat because i'm pregnant and i think you probably don't love me anymore because i'm not thin and exciting anymore\" <----actual lines from the main girl in this book. please. please. someone bleach my eyes because blargh.i will write about this in english class because i have to. but i'm saying this right now: i never want to have to read hemingway again. and i can find nothing good about this story. you heard that. nothinggggggggg. i could rant for a very long time, but oh well. we're doing great. 1 star and please, spare yourself from ever having to read this book. if you have read it: i pity you, poor soul. better luck next time.faith out. have a great day :d    \n",

(for example, the brand-new european railway system is heavily featured throughout the book, and especially the fact that in a half-day's ride, you could go literally from the battlefront to a five-star luxury hotel, something that had never been possible before wwi.) oh, and if all this wasn't enough, hemingway throws in a love story too, a complicated one featuring a complicated woman, one that has been a source of heated interpretation since the book first came out 79 years ago.the argument for it being a classic:there seems to be two main arguments for this being a classic, one based on the author and one on the book itself. because the fact is that hemingway is considered by many to be one of the most important novelists in the history of that format, a fabled \"high priest of modernism\" who taught all of us to think in a punchier, shorter way, and with this mostly being for the better for the arts in general. because let's not forget, a mere twenty or thirty years before this book was first published, it was actually the flowery and overwritten victorian style of literature that dominated the publishing industry; and as we've all learned throughout the course of this \"cclap 100\" essay series, although victorian literature certainly has its charms and inherent strengths, it's also a whole lot of talking to say not much at all, a situation that was starting to drive artists crazy by the time the 20th century got into swing. hemingway, fans claim, was the first modernist to really bring all the details together in a profoundly great way -- the first to combine the exciting rat-a-tat style of pulp-fiction writers with the weighty subjects of the academic community, producing work that owes as much to raymond chandler as it does to virginia woolf but is ultimately much better than simply reading those two authors back-to-back. and by making its subject world war i, fans say, hemingway here turns in yet another great document of those times that the early modernists were known for -- from the great gatsby to all quiet among the western front, it's hard for us to even think of the artists from the \"jazz age\" or \"lost generation\" or whatever you want to call it, without thinking of this globe-changing event that was so in the middle of it. there's a good reason, after all, that many consider a farewell to arms one of the greatest war novels of all time.the argument against:of course, there are others who can't even hear the words \"ernest hemingway\" without automatically shuddering, again for a variety of reasons that even most of his fans admit hold at least some weight -- because he is overrated by the academic community, because his personal style is a hackneyed, easily parodied one, because his \"man's man\" shtick got real old real fast, because it's now inspired three generations of a--holes (and counting) to want to be bull-fleeing, cigar-smoking woman-haters too. at its heart, its critics say, a farewell to arms is an interesting-enough little ditty, mostly because hemingway himself had some interesting little experiences during the war that he basically cribbed wholesale for the book; but then this story is covered with layer after layer of bad prose, macho posturing, and aimless meanderings that get you about as far away from a traditional three-act novel as you can possibly get. with hemingway and his critics, it's never a case of \"it's a good enough book but shouldn't be labeled a classic;\" those who dislike him really dislike him, and wish to see his work removed from academic reading lists altogether. \"classic\" label or not.my verdict:so let me embarrassingly admit that this is actually the very first book by hemingway i've ever read, and that i was hesitant going into it because of just the overwhelming amount of bad stuff that's been said about him over the decades; to be truthful, i was half-expecting a parody of hemingway at this point, all little words and nonsensical sentences and dudes treating girls kinda like crap most of the time. and yes, the book does for sure contain a certain amount of all this; but i was surprised, to tell you the truth, by how how tight, illuminating, fascinating and just plain funny a farewell to arms turned out to actually be. wait, funny, you say? sure; i dare you not to laugh, for example, during the scene when a huge argument breaks out between two swiss border guards over which of their two hometowns boasts better winter sports. (\"ah, you see? he does not even know what a luge is!\") this is what makes it such an intriguing novel about war, after all, because hemingway expertly shows just how many surreal moments there are during times of war as well, that \"war\" doesn't just mean the two lines of soldiers facing each other at the front but also an entire region, an entire industry, an entire population. hemingway's world war i is not just seen from the smeared windshield of a battlefront ambulance, but from bored soldiers getting drunk in a quiet bunker, from weary villagers hoping there will be at least something left of their homes after the war is over, from armchair pundits recovering in crumbling veteran hospitals, arguing over which complicated international treaty sunk them all and which is going to save them. it's an expansive, multi-facted, sometimes highly unique look at a wartime environment, one that at least here in his early career (he published this when he was 30) belies all the complaints that have ever been made about his hackneyed personal style.and as far as that love story in the middle of it all, and the repeated complaints about hemingway's characters all being misogynists...well, maybe it was just me, but i found his catherine barkley to be the very model of a modern independent woman (or at least modern and independent in 1920s terms), a fiercely intelligent and cynical creature who expects the same from her lovers, even while realizing that such a man is destined to either die in the environment they're currently in, or survive just to become a bitter, angry a--hole later in life. the way i see it, catherine is simply trying to make the best of a bad situation; she needs love and intimacy in her life as much as anyone else, and especially in her role as a risk-taking, thick-skinned nurse just a few miles from the battle's front, but also understands that tenente is destined to befall one of the two fates just mentioned, thus explaining the curious push/pull emotions she has towards him and the way she treats him throughout the novel. it's a surprisingly sophisticated relationship at work, the same thing that can be said of the novel in general; i don't know about the rest of hemingway's work (yet, anyway), but at least a farewell to arms turned out to be a surprisingly cracking read, not only a definite classic but just an all-around amazing book in general. it comes highly recommended today.is it a classic? yes    \n",

can't yell anywhere else...let's do a roast review because that is who i am. when in doubt...roast.meet i. our protagonist. also known as \"tenente\". hemingway assumes that his average american reader knows that this means \"lieutenant\" in italian. news flash: the average american reader is unaware of this fact, and thus i spent the first 100 pages of the book thinking that \"tenente\" was i's actual name. this is a technique that works in flash fiction, people. not in actual novels. cue the screaming. (also, this guy's name is \"federic henry\", which is apparently an american name, and from which one can also derive the nickname of \"fred\".) meet miss barkley (also known as catherine), our love interest. she was the angsty, insecure, clingy, codependent girlfriend before it was cool. the only problem, of course, is that there is absolutely 0 backstory to explain why she's like this, and we never get an explanation. i lies to her once, and as a result, she will never trust him again or something whaaaaaaa except that's never stated. it's just implied. like everything in this book.the other characters? who needs them? we've got rinaldi, easily the most entertaining character in the book--except that we don't really know anything about him. all we know is that he's the original sassy gay best friend. (or at least, i'm assuming he's gay. he spends the entire book calling \"i\" \"baby\" and asking him for kisses and this does not mean cheek kisses, y'all). except he's also very into women. so. is he bi? is he just really troubled? is this a really bad impression of italians? hemingway either: 1) doesn't know or 2) doesn't care.speaking of italians: hemingway informs us that \"i\" doesn't know how to spell in italian. this is a clever ruse to disguise the fact that hemingway himself doesn't know how to spell in italian. as someone who knows a bit of the language and definitely how to spell some of the common words, i cringed every time they spoke in italian. because. he mispelled \"hi\" in italian. how does one even do that. i know hemingway has been lauded as a brilliant writer and i know it's a different time period. i'm going to try not to bring fitzgerald into this review even though i could sing about how much i love fitzgerald's writing style for at least a year. the writing style sucks okay. it really does. it's flat and uninspired and this guy has no clue how to use commas or dialogue tags. so half the time i had no clue who was talking and i just skimmed conversations (which is fine, they're literally all extraneous) because i couldn't keep up. how does one get away with writing like that? howwww????!!!!!also, can i just mention: i had no idea that americans in the italian army were as rich as they were, or that they had to do as little fighting in world war one as this guy did, because he'd never been in combat before getting his leg badly injured, and i swear he had so much money he never needed to work another day in his life. his girlfriend really just stayed with him for the money, i think. he literally bought a cabin in the mountains in switzerland and drank to excess at swiss bars every single day and he never worked and never got paid. like...how.i could write an entire review about hemingway's characters' view of women, but for right now, let's just say: he writes women like they're the worst (probably because he only knew flappers and they were kind of troubled), and his male characters are so obsessed with women that i was embarrassed to the point of literal actual tears at one point. that's right, y'all. this book literally made me cry from anger. because these men...my goodness. the women are objects. we're at war so that we can sleep with all the girls who come along. these two innocent, small, helpless girls who need help escaping the german advance in italy? man, i wish we weren't so busy retreating...if we weren't heaven knows we'd be cheering our luck about finding a couple of virgins on the side of the road. (please note: these two girls were fourteen and fifteen.) also the romantic relationship was entirely built off codependency and cruelty and this is not love, people. it genuinely isn't. \"am i a good girl?\" \"please tell me i'm doing well. i just want to please you.\" \"the rain doesn't change how much you love me, does it?\" \"i'm so fat because i'm pregnant and i think you probably don't love me anymore because i'm not thin and exciting anymore\" <----actual lines from the main girl in this book. please. please. someone bleach my eyes because blargh.i will write about this in english class because i have to. but i'm saying this right now: i never want to have to read hemingway again. and i can find nothing good about this story. you heard that. nothinggggggggg. i could rant for a very long time, but oh well. we're doing great. 1 star and please, spare yourself from ever having to read this book. if you have read it: i pity you, poor soul. better luck next time.faith out. have a great day :d    \n",

                                                          a powerful, important message in a weak novel! as a classic, harriet beecher stowe's uncle tom's cabin deserves its status as a powerful indictment against the history of black slavery in america. with courage and insight unprecedented in her time, stowe uses moving family tales of a number of black and white families to pillory the violence and hatred to which blacks were subjected prior to the american civil war and thrills the reader with convincing philosophical debates that reveal the astonishing hypocrisy and weak-willed rationalizations that the white population used to justify their actions. stowe's frank, terrifyingly banal and utterly unabashed presentation of slavery, slave trading, white attitudes and the laws of the ante-bellum us southern states will turn most modern readers red and shame-faced with embarrassment that these events actually form a part of their country's heritage. but, as a novel, uncle tom's cabin is unsatisfying, overly long and poorly edited. stowe's insistence on writing her dialogue in a faux black english dialect is unconvincing at best and is actually often irritating and distracting as it becomes more and more difficult to decipher what her characters are actually trying to say. her insistence on preaching and using christian church teachings and the bible as the primary basis for criticizing prejudice, racism and slavery frankly grated my sensibilities. there is plenty enough wrong with slavery and its history in america from a purely humanist point of view without resorting to what would be categorized as \"bible thumping\" today. (that said, i will admit that it may have been an appropriate approach to convince what she saw as her potential audience at the time). the white characters she uses to support and convey her message of understanding, compassion and her political agenda of abolition are so sugary sweet as to be positively cloying. a scene in which her primary white character, evangeline st clare, gathers her family and her family's slaves around her death bed in order to distribute locks of her hair to one and all was so melodramatic and pointless as to approach the level of bizarre. i would never say to any potential future reader that i enjoyed uncle tom's cabin. i didn't! in fact, at times, it was even a struggle to finish it. but the message, the history, the overwhelming importance and the power of the arguments conveyed by the story are more than enough reason to read it anyway. if enough people take the message to heart then perhaps the world has a possibility of avoiding repetition of events like the holocaust, the rwandan genocide, the rape of nanking or the slaughter of the muslims in bosnia by the serbs. paul weiss   \n",
