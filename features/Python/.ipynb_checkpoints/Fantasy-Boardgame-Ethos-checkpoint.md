# How Learning Python is Like Reading a Fantasy Novel or Learning a Complicated Boardgame (But With More Error Messages)

The first few times that I tried to learn Python --- yes, it took me multiple tries! --- it felt like learning a bunch of arbitrary rules about an imaginary universe. It turns out that Python *is* kind of like an imaginary universe with made-up rules. That's part of what makes it fun. But it can also make learning Python difficult if you don't really know what the world looks like or how it functions or how its imaginary universe relates to *your* universe and your specific goals --- such as doing text analysis or making a Twitter bot or creating a network visualization.

> For example, in Python, there are four basic data types --- *Strings*, *Integers*, *Floats*, and *Booleans* --- and each data type has a different set of characteristics and affordances. Learning this information without more context feels a bit like learning the detailed differences between *Hobbits*, *Trolls*, and *Orcs* without knowing more about the world of J.R.R. Tolkein's *Lord of the Rings*. It doesn't make any sense! Why should you care!

In Lesson 1, we try to short-circuit this problem, 

You might also think about learning Python like learning a complicated boardgame. When I first start reading a fantasy novel or playing a new boardgame, for example, the character names and rules usually feel very complicated and confusing. For a brief moment, I fear that I will *never* understand. But then that moment passes, and I have faith and patience that I will *eventually* understand, because I've read a lot of fantasy novels and learned a lot of boardgames before. I know that it always feels this way.

Learning Python requires even more faith and patience than reading a fantasy novel or a new boardgame, however, because *things are always going wrong*. Seriously. That's the hallmark of coding and the one thing you can be sure of. You're going to face a lot of error messages, and that's perfectly normal and good. As Cecily Carver puts it:

> I’ve found that a big difference between new coders and experienced coders is faith: faith that things are going wrong for a logical and discoverable reason, faith that problems are fixable, faith that there is a way to accomplish the goal. The path from “not working” to “working” might not be obvious, but with patience you can usually find it.

So take heart and have faith!
