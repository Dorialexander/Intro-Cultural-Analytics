Computational analysis of texts typically becomes more interesting as the scale of the texts increases though maybe there may still be some interpretations we could make.

#with open(filepath_of_text, encoding="utf-8") as file_object:
#    full_text = file_object.read()


### Installing Git Bash for Windows

1. Download Git Bash for Windows by clicking on the following link: https://git-scm.com/download/win. Open the .exe file and allow Git Bash to make changes to your computer.

2. Accept all the default settings in the installation.

3. Open the Start menu and type “Git Bash” into the search bar. Click the “Git Bash Desktop App” 

Yeesh!

Looks like *Pride and Prejudice* is a bit of a mess right now. It's a big smushed blob with a lot of `\n`s, which means "new line" and indicates where all the line breaks should be.

*Sometimes these libraries/packages/modules are already built into Python or come prep-packaged with Anaconda, but sometimes you have to install them before you `import` them.*

> For example, in Python, there are four basic data types --- *Strings*, *Integers*, *Floats*, and *Booleans* --- and each data type has a different set of characteristics and affordances. Learning this information without more context feels a bit like learning the detailed differences between *Hobbits*, *Trolls*, and *Orcs* without knowing more about the world of J.R.R. Tolkein's *Lord of the Rings*. It doesn't make any sense!

> We'll learn more about Python's basic data types in the next lesson, but first we're going to get a glimpse of the Python world and understand why you should care about data types.


Sometimes I also think about learning Python like learning a complicated boardgame. Boardgames don't really make sense until you know what you're trying to accomplish, and often the best way to learn a new boardgame is to watch or play a practice round. So that's what we're going to do now. 

Without seeing more of this world or knowing the end goal (trying to destroy The Ring!), it would be hard to see how I could actually use the information that I was learning or how it all built up to a bigger picture.


> Imagine trying to understand the *Harry Potter* universe by first learning the basics of Quidditch. *Lesson 1: There are two kinds of balls --- a Quaffle and a Snitch --- but only the Seeker can catch the Snitch.* Ok...but what world are we in, and why does this matter?! If you don't know anything more about J.K. Rowling's Wizarding World, this information won't make very much sense!


I think it's helpful to get a better understanding also think it's a So we're going to begin by getting a glimpse of the Python universe in context and in action.

We're starting from this zoomed-up perspective for another related reason: to develop our coding literacy skills. By the end of this class, you should be able to read a Python script and understand what it's doing.


One of the coolest things about Python (and really programming in general) is the community. The Python community manifests itself in many ways, but one cool thing is that you don't have to do everything yourself. You don't necessarily have to code everything from scratch. Other people have written code that you can reuse, and they've often written in a way that will be convenient for you. Code written by others that you can use in your own scripts are called "libraries" and "modules."

At the top of a Python script, you will often find a series of `import` statements, as seen below, which go and grab different libraries and modules so you can use them.


oardgames don't make sense until you know what you're trying to accomplish, and sometimes the best way to learn a new boardgame is to watch or play a practice round. So that's what we're going to do now. We're going to demonstrate what working Python code looks like in action, sort of like watching a practice round, so you can get a feel for the structure and flow of Python.

Similarly, I would encourage you to adopt a "fantasy novel" or "complicated boardgame" *ethos* when you approach learning Python and programming in general. For example, when I first start reading a fantasy novel or playing a new boardgame, the character names and rules usually feel very complicated and confusing. For a brief moment, I fear that I will *never* understand. But then that moment passes, and I have faith and patience that I will *eventually* understand, because I've read a lot of fantasy novels and learned a lot of boardgames before. I know that it always feels this way.

Learning to code requires even more faith and patience than fantasy novels and boardgames, however, because things are always going wrong.
