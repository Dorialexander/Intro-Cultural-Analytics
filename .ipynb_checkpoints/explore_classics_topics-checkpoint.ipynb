It's **time** for something darker. Ten people receive an invitation to attend a party at Soldier Island. All decide to respond, rejoicing at the prospect of an unexpected holiday. Once they reach the island, they realise that they are not there for fun. Instead, a homicidal maniac is out to **get** them. They are the soldiers! And they were to fall **one** by **one** until there were none left.All the guests assembled are guilty of certain crimes that **went** unpunished by law, and this unknown (U.N.Owen) person has decided to bring justice to them. As **one** by **one** they fall, the soldier figurines on the centre table disappear. This intriguing touch relates the story well to the nursery rhyme, a tactic that Christie uses well once again. The red herrings strewn along the story line take care of the reader not guessing at the murderer's identity. My favourite Christie and **one** of the most intriguing and unique mystery stories, And Then There Were None is a must-read for fans of the genre."

       "Celebrity Deathmatch Review: 1984 vs. The Annotated AliceAlice was sitting next to her sister, who was absent-mindedly gazing to the ground. They were sitting on a huge rock, in a drab and gloomy place once known as Hyde Park.“What are you staring at?” asked Alice abruptly.“Staring? What is ‘staring’?” asked her sister without moving her gaze. “Staring means looking continuously at something without moving your eyes away, just **like** what you are doing now,” **said** Alice. “What is ‘means’? What is 'continuously'? Why are you talking ungood again?” **said** her sister reproachfully. “When last year father was talking **like** this, I told the thought police about him. They took him away for a long **time** and when he came **back**, he was talking doubleplusgood. Do you want me to tell them about you?”“No, no. I don’t want to go away. I was just asking what you were looking at” **said** Alice fearfully. Her sister didn't reply and seemed not paying attention to her. Once, when Alice was on her way **home**, she stumbled upon a very **old** blue book upon which was written \"Oxford Concise Dictionary\" in big letters. She took the book **home** and showed it to her father. The latter seemed very interested in it and kept it hidden inside **one** of the **old** unused pillows. He told her not to tell anyone about it, and when she asked him why, he told her a silly story which Alice can't even remember now. Only Alice and her father knew about it and she used to look up words every couple of days, which her father taught her to do. Sitting in the gloomy place, Alice felt very bored and started looking **around**. Some ten yards away she saw a huge brown rat, which was moving its mouth and seemed to be making some noise. When Alice came near it, she heard it saying: “I’m late. I must hurry!” These words were very familiar to Alice. When the rat began running and **went** behind a huge rock, Alice followed it and as she reached the place, she saw a dining table on which dozens of ugly rats were eating and drinking while chatting very loudly.“Long live Big Brother” **said** **one** of the rats suddenly, raising its glass of Victory gin. When the others heard this, they all raised their glasses and shouted at once: “long live Big Brother.”Alice scowled. She used to hear these words at school for several times each **day**. She hated them. Every **time** she had managed to start a conversation with a friend about toys, candies, or Imaginary places, the teacher used to shout “Long Live Big Brother,” and they had to repeat the words after her.  One of the rats, who seemed to be taking interest in Alice, came near her. “Hello my child. What are you doing here?” **said** the rat with a familiar tone.“Hello. I followed the brown rat,\" **said** Alice. \"I once dreamed of a talking white rabbit, which I followed into a very beautiful and curious place. There, I used to grow and shrink in size, and saw talking animals which played games with me. There were even rats there, but not as ugly as you_” she regretted the last sentence, but the rat didn't seem to pay attention to it. “And?” **said** the rat.“And that’s it. It was a very nice place. Much more beautiful than here,\" **said** Alice with a frown.“Hmm. Now tell me about the way you speak my dear” **said** the rat, with a malicious grin.Alice suddenly realized that she was inadvertently using words from the dictionary, and the rat understood them. She remembered that every **time** she accidentally used words from it with a friend or a family member (her father told her not to do so), they didn't understand what she was saying. “Tell me my dear,\" repeated the rat, \"how do you **know** so many words?” She tried to think about an answer, when the rat suddenly took out its hand, which was holding the very dictionary, from its pocket. “Is this the reason?” **said** the rat pointing to the dictionary.Alice didn't understand what was happening and how the rat had the dictionary. She suddenly realized that dozens of rats were rushing towards her and began taking her away. She started crying and tried to free herself, asking them to be taken **back** to her sister, but no **one** paid attention to her.  All the rats disappeared except the **one** with the dictionary and another fat and extremely ugly **one**. Both took off their disguise and turned out to be members of the thought police. “Good job comrade” **said** the fat man, who seemed to be the chief. “Let me **know** your name once more.”“Smith, Winston Smith” **said** the man, who was now burning the dictionary with the same malicious grin.Matchpoint: 1984"

       "Another fantastic mystery by Agatha Christie! I will say, I feel that I **would** have enjoyed it more if there weren’t such overly used themes and tropes throughout the story. A group of strangers find themselves isolated together with a killer on the loose whose intent is to pick them off **one** by **one**- the start to so many scary books and movies. Though I am sure this was new and exciting when written, today it is an overly used theme and unfortunately, I didn’t find the story too surprising. That being **said**, it was still fantastically written and an overall enjoyable book! I do **like** how knowing the poem gave the characters and reader an idea of how the next victim was **going** to die, building the suspense. “Ten **little** Indian boys **went** out to dine; One choked his **little** self and then there were nine.Nine **little** Indian boys sat up very late; One overslept himself and then there were eight.Eight **little** Indian boys travelling in Devon; One **said** he’d stay there and then there were seven.Seven **little** Indian boys chopping up sticks; One chopped himself in halves and then there were six. Six **little** Indian boys playing with a hive; A bumblebee stung **one** and then there were five.Five **little** Indian boys **going** in for law; One **got** in Chancery and then there were four.Four **little** Indian boys **going** out to sea; A red herring swallowed **one** and then there were three. Three **little** Indian boys walking in the Zoo; A big bear hugged **one** and then there were **two**.Two **little** Indian boys sitting in the sun; One **got** frizzled up and then there was **one**.One **little** Indian boy left all alone; He **went** and hanged himself and then there were none.” PS: If you have a moment, look up the history of this book’s name. It’s crazy how much times have changed and I found it rather fascinating!For more reviews: rusticpages.blog"

Owen to stay at the mysterious Soldier Island. There is a jingle of sorts in each of their rooms (quoted above) and the murders start happening from there on out.  The whole mystery is basically, who is killing them? is it **one** of the 10 people? Is there someone else on the island? This was gripping and **like** I was hooked. So intriguing and I just kept theorizing a possible conclusion. It was fast paced as well. I didn't love how we jumped a ton from character to character at times it was a **little** much, especially at the beginning when you are getting introduced to them. By the end though I **could** see why Christie wrote it this way.    “In the midst of life, we are in death.”  The jingle was so clever and the overall reveal blew my mind. I can't believe I didn't see that coming ughhhhhh. I wish we **got** another **like** 20 pages explaining the whole thing though, as it was explained but I personally just wanted to read more about it. This was my first novel that I have read by Christie, and do plan to pick up more of her work in the future. This was overall very clever and addictive. "

From Munich to Stuttgart, these boys were making noise while I sipped Gatorade tried to nap away my beer tent inspired nausea. It didn't help that somehow my ticket was in the smoking car of the train when I specifically asked for the non-smoking area...anyway, I was dozing and woke up when something grazed by arm. No, it wasn't the **old** dude smoking his cigar next to me getting fresh, it was **two** boys from the class locked into some sort of fist fight in the aisle. I jumped up and moved to pull the boys apart but their teacher interveined at that same moment. And I watched as the teacher scoled the smaller, nerdy, recorder player as the asshole bully smirked. And then the recorder kid started to cry which led to more taunting and I shook my head thinking, \"oh man, that is not **going** to help you **get** teased any less\". It was **one** of the moments that I wished I knew German so I **could** rip into those kids and their teacher. I hope they never end up on a deserted island as a class. "

       "This was my first Agatha Christie read for book club this month. Not sure why I waited this long to read a Christie novel; she is quite the storyteller.The mystery on Solider Island eerily follows the following poem:Ten **little** Soldier Boys **went** out to dine; One choked his **little** self and then there were nine.Nine **little** Soldier Boys sat up very late; One overslept himself and then there were eight.Eight **little** Soldier Boys travelling in Devon; One **said** he’d stay there and then there were seven.Seven **little** Soldier Boys chopping up sticks; One chopped himself in halves and then there were six.Six **little** Soldier Boys playing with a hive; A bumblebee stung **one** and then there were five.Five **little** Soldier Boys **going** in for law; One **got** in Chancery and then there were four.Four **little** Soldier Boys **going** out to sea; A red herring swallowed **one** and then there were three.Three **little** Soldier Boys walking in the zoo; A big bear hugged **one** and then there were **two**.Two **little** Soldier Boys sitting in the sun; One **got** frizzled up and then there was **one**.One **little** Soldier Boy left all alone; He **went** out and hanged himself and then there were none.I think the poem says it all: its all the info you need to **know** before venturing into this mystery. While reading you will play detective to see if you can solve the crime before it is revealed in the end.It was a quick read at 264 pages. I didn’t **know** how Agatha was **going** to pull it off: I was surprised, but then mad that I didn’t figure it out because it was **right** in front of my face! Have you read this **one** and did you **know** who it was in the end?! (no details, as we don’t want to spoil it for the others)UPDATE: I did not **know** there was controversy **around** an original racist title of this book that correlated with the original subject of this poem. I probably **would** not have read it if I had known. I **know** it was 1939, but this was not an author who was writing on such subjects calling out racism ahead of her **time**, it was more than likely just what she knew. Its not sitting well with me currently. To read my reviews visit: www.saturdaynitereader.com"

       "An imaginary Review !-----------------My **two** friends with me… In the park…. After reading this book ! \"Did you understand a word of all that?\" my friend asked me. \"Surely he's not trying to make fools of us\". I Said. \"He **could** be seriously ill and we're making him suffer.\" He cried. \"Hey!.. You both finished the book?\" Another friend called from the other side. We communicated across, Gregor Samsa's situation. \"You'll have to go for the doctor straight away. Gregor is ill. Quick, **get** the doctor. Did you hear the way Gregor spoke that **time**?\" \"That was the voice of an animal\", **said** the first friend, reminding a situation from the book, facetiously. \"Ha! Ha!\" I laughed, clapping my hands, \"**get** a doc here, now!\"  Then at the same moment **two** girls, their skirts swishing, immediately ran out through the park and a moment later, from the same direction **two** stout male doctors, dressed in white, entered in the park. They reached to us and asked in feminine voice, “Where is Gregor ?……Only he can help us. We are metamorphosed. We had just finished Metamorphosis this morning!”--------------------Such a beautiful story with such a real looking, imaginary impact :)"

       "Twain takes a hard-hitting look at the dark, seamy underbelly of an American childhood. Who'd a thunk that this small Missouri town **could** be such a horrifying place to spend **one**'s formative years? So much ignorance and superstition . . .  \"You **got** to go all by yourself, to the middle of the woods, where you **know** there's a spunk-water stump, and just as it's midnight you **back** up against the stump and jam your hand in and say: 'Barley-corn, Barley-corn, injun-meal shorts,Spunk-water, spunk-water, swaller these warts,'and then walk away quick, eleven steps, with your eyes shut, and then turn **around** three times and walk **home** without speaking to anybody.\" Children fighting **right** in the streets . . .  In an instant both boys were rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped together **like** cats; and for the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each other's hair and clothes, punched and scratched each other's noses, and covered themselves with dust and glory. Corporal punishment . . .  The schoolmaster, always severe, grew severer and more exacting than ever, for he wanted the school to make a good showing on \"Examination\" **day**. His rod and his ferule were seldom idle now -- at least among the smaller pupils. Only the biggest boys, and young ladies of eighteen and twenty, escaped lashing. Rampant nudity . . . After breakfast they **went** whooping and prancing out on the bar, and chased each other round and round, shedding clothes as they **went**, until they were naked . . .  Failure to report a felony . . .  And even sexual harassment . . . Tom clasped her about her neck and pleaded:\"Now, Becky, it's all done -- all over but the kiss. Don't you be afraid of that -- it ain't anything at all. Please, Becky.\" And he tugged at her apron and the hands. (#BeckyThatcher #MeToo)  Yikes! What a scary world they lived in **back** then. Kids today have it so much easier, don't they?"

       "One, or An Other Story about Humbert HumbertThey entered the novel at **night**, by stealth, and took up position on the sixth floor of the Book Depository Building. Then they waited for the morning to come.Only **one** of them was armed. The others had come along to lend moral support. They had never been involved in a character assassination before. If the truth be told, they were a **little** nervous. They surveyed the roofs and windows of the adjacent buildings. They were pretty sure nobody was watching. Nobody was there to watch. Everybody was downstairs, lining the streets, waiting for the Mardi Gras floats to pass, happy, cheering the contestants they liked, remaining silent or jeering the ones they didn’t.The **one** opened his case, took out the parts of his rifle, and assembled it with practised precision. The last item to be put in place was the telescopic lens. He lifted the rifle to his shoulder and looked through the lens. The first thing he saw was the streetscape below. Then he scrolled to the **right** until he saw the T-junction **around** which Humbert and Dolores **would** come.He didn’t have to wait long. Three minutes. Perhaps it **would** have taken another **two** minutes for their open limousine to reach the point where it was closest and the line of vision was clearest. The **one** had rehearsed everything the previous weekend.Twenty seconds later, **one** of them whispered, \"Now! Now!\" The tension had been too much. Without removing his eye from the lens, the **one** smiled. It was a signal that the others took for permission to relax. The **one** knew what he was doing. He had done it before. He **would** do it again, although they didn’t **know** that at the **time**.Another forty seconds later, the **one** dropped the rifle from his shoulder. One of the others asked, \"What are you doing?\" The **one** didn’t answer. With a single deft action, he removed the silencer. He placed his left elbow on the window ledge, lifted the rifle and pushed the barrel between the drawn curtains.He only waited ten seconds more. He found Humbert’s head through the lens, then thought better of it, even though he had planned his course of action methodically. He lowered the rifle a fraction and fired the first shot into Humbert’s heart. If Humbert’s perverse story was to be believed, that was its lifeblood, its source, its origin. It was a direct hit. Humbert didn’t explode. In this way, at least, it was all a bit disappointing for the **one**’s audience. His head nodded forward, then slumped backwards, though Humbert still seemed to be alive, wondering what had happened, what did his author have in store for him? Surely, it wasn’t’ **going** to end **like** this, with a bang?The blood pumped wildly out of Humbert’s heart, though it was mainly invisible to this audience, held in by his vest, barely staining his pressed white business shirt. Humbert’s head tilted forward slightly, as the life fled his limp body. The **one** **could** still see his face. His next shot tore into Humbert’s left eye. The third shot was aimed for his **right** eye. Up to this moment, nobody on the street **could** tell anything untoward had happened. Even the sound of the rifle shots had been less than expected, drowned out by the carnival music and crowd noise.With the third shot, Humbert’s head finally did explode, propelling a slurry of brain and blood and bone fragments, willy nilly, over Dolores and her pretty pink floral dress. She took off her heart-shaped glasses and looked up, until she seemed to detect the windows in the Book Depository Building. Only she ever appeared to see the **one** and the others who were peeking tentatively through the windows on the **one**’s left, so as not to be in his way. She kept her silence though.There were still forty seconds remaining. The **one** didn’t wait to witness the commotion. He **could** watch it on TV as soon as he **got** **back** to his hotel room.He had three bullets left. He turned and faced the door of the apartment. He looked at his watch. Twenty seconds, ten seconds, five seconds. The door smashed open, even though it was unlocked and **could** have been pushed open.\"What have you done?\" The man was alone, older than the **one** expected, paunchier. He **could** imagine his sly, intellectualized grin as he sat at his desk, composing his lecherous words in the comfort of his deceitful monogamous relationship.\"How dare you!\" Was it a challenge? Was it a question that the **one** genuinely wanted to be answered? No response came. Nabokov simply continued his approach towards the **one**.With the same efficiency with which he had dispatched Humbert, the **one** fired the remaining three bullets into the author. They were all aimed for the heart. Nabokov fell backwards onto the floor. He grimaced in pain as his hand reached for his bloody red chest and he realised his **time** had finally come.The **one** noticed Nabokov’s eyelids start to descend. He put his rifle down and knelt beside Nabokov. With his left thumb and forefinger, he separated Nabokov’s eyelids and stared into his eyes, watching as all sign of life escaped them. Eventually, the author was dead. It was **time** for each of them to turn their **back** on the novel now, safe, and come **back** to reality. Life for the **one**, for the others, **could** resume as intended, as normal. The **one** had righted another wrong."

       "I was eating a hotdog **right** after reading Slaughterhouse-Five, and as I was contemplating on what to write for my review, I was suddenly attacked by a bunch of three-headed toads. They called themselves \"the three-headed toads\" and they wore Mexican sombreros and Nickelback t-shirts. They were roughly the size of Peter Dinklage and were colored from neon pink to dark orange. For some unknown reason, their leader named Pedro the Pope decided to declare war on hotdog eating humans. I was tragically their first victim. I wet my pants. As the toad named Lollipop Susanna tried to poke me with a rusty Swiss-knife, Pedro the Pope saw in my hand Slaughterhouse-Five. He read it from cover-to-cover in about 37 seconds. Three-headed toads read very fast. Surprisingly, it was the only fast thing they **could** do. They read lots of books, and somewhere along **one** of those books, they read that hotdogs caused global-warming. They despised hotdogs. So it goes.After reading Slaughterhouse-Five, Pedro the Pope decided that he didn't **like** wars anymore. He now despised wars more than hotdogs. He was very easy to convince. Hanky-doodle, the neon pink toad with a disposable spork on his hand, suddenly burst out with random shrieks of \"Snakes are noodle-pussies! Snakes are noodle-pussies!\" He was not **right** in the heads. I was mortified. I wet my pants again. So it goes.Pedro the Pope then asked me if whether or not I knew where Tralfamadore was. Three-headed toads did not understand the concept of fiction. I decided to point him in the general direction of my toilet. I **said** there was a portal there and that all they needed to do was to flush away. After a few moments, I heard some serious flushing. The last thing I heard was \"Ribbit!\" So it goes.I waited a few moments to make sure that they weren't there anymore. When I came in, I saw something written using lipstick on my toilet: \"WaRz R nuT kool!\"I wet my pants with a steady stream of urine joy. "

       "It was 1962. I was living in Vacaville, CA working at the A&W as a carhop when a young soldier from Travis Air Force Base **got** out of his car and began walking. He was carrying a bundle of letters which he placed in the garbage can behind the building. I found them when I took out the garbage that **night** and picked them up. I carried them into the building and hid them in my purse and then took them **home**. They were Dear John letters, but all I remember were these words: “I am **going** to join a convent.” I thought about them, wondering who they were. They weren’t just names on letters; they were people who were suffering. I still think about them from **time** to **time**. Did he die in Vietnam or is he happily married? How about her? Did she become a nun or was that just a line? I kept the letters for many years, wishing I **could** write to them to see how they were, to tell them that I had the letters, but then I thought it not proper. And then **one** **day** I carried them to my garbage can and threw them away. For many more years I saved the Lipton tea bag label that she had placed in **one** of her letters. Inscribed on it were the words: “To forgive is to forget.” It was ’69, and I was hanging out in Berkeley, studying and **going** out dancing. Mac was in Vietnam carrying a rifle and maybe letters or photographs, I never asked. I saw them on the streets of Berkeley, holding out their hands for spare change, talking in strange tongues, sleeping on the sidewalks in doorways, and in People’s Park. The sign on the door of the Vedanta Society across the street from People’s Park, **said**, “Do not sleep on the steps,” and I thought, “How charitable.” Years later at a Vietnamese Buddhist monastery an Australian monk gave my husband a book to read about a monk who had been in Vietnam. I read it instead of my husband, and then I wrote this poem in memory of what the monk in the book had seen in Vietnam:LIVING IN BERKELEY BACK IN NAMI saw you standingin front of the market on Telegraph Avenueasking for spare change.With fearseeping throughthe shadowsof your hallowed eyes,you let me **know** that you were **back** in Nam,where you watched your buddyholding a Vietnamese babyin his protecting arms,blow upbefore those very eyesthat I am staringinto now.In **one** breathyou told me that itwasn’t real, that itnever really happened;in the next breathyou asked me “Why?”And I had no answerother than to offer youa few coins. And you walked into that storeto buy yourself anotherbottle of wine.I turned **around**, andI was **back** in Berkeley. The street vendorswere selling their wares:puka shell necklaces,quill earrings,stone pottery,and tie died shirts withpeace emblems— reminding methat Nam wasnever far away.I walked **around** the corner.A flyer dangled from atelephone pole.Maharishi’s liquid eyes stared **back** at mineand promised peace,if only we **would** forget the world andlet goof all thethoughtsthat kept pouringinto our minds,during a **time** when we only wanted to stopthat damn war in Vietnam.I was apolitical during those troubled timesand had my own wargoing on deep inside. So I spent my dayswith friendsin the Renaissance Cafédrinking cappuccinos and eating chocolate croissants,while talking about **going** to Aito’sto dance to Greek musicon Friday nights. --jessica slade magorian  july 11, 2005I met Mac in ’88. Fun loving and as **one** friend of ours **said** to me, “He is the kindest man I have ever met.” Mac’s buddy walked up to him **one** **night** when he was in the trenches. “Mac, can I change places with you tonight? I feel **like** it is my **time**. I am **going** to die tonight.” Mac changed places with his buddy, just to ease his mind. The next morning Mac was asked to pick up his buddy’s body parts and put them into a bag and carry them away. He has carried this with him all of these years, but he doesn’t talk about it to anyone. I heard it twice and just tried to remember the details.Mac now carries an oxygen Pac with him wherever he goes and all because he had carried that orange dust **around** with him in Vietnam for way too long. Sometimes, he proudly wears his Marine baseball cap, and when men see it they say, “Thanks for your service,” And I want to say, “F… the military,” and then I wish that I had spent my **time** in Berkeley **going** to anti-war demonstrations instead of sitting in the Renaissance Café drinking cappuccino.

       "For the Celebrity Death Match Review Tournament, Hamlet vs Winnie-the-Pooh… Sometimes Winnie-the-Pooh likes a game of some sort when he comes downstairs, and sometimes he likes to sit quietly in front of the fire and listen to a story. This eve- ning— \t\"What about a story?\" **said** Christopher Robin. \t\"What about a story?\" I **said**. \t\"Could you very sweetly tell Winnie-the-Pooh **one**?\" \t\"I suppose I **could**,\" I **said**. \"What sort of stories does he **like**?\" \t\"About himself. Because he's that sort of Bear.\" \t\"Oh, I see. Well, this particular story is not about him, but it’s something that I think you both **would** **like** very much.\" \t\"So **could** you very sweetly?\" \t\"I'll try,\" I **said**. \tSo I tried. \tOnce upon a **time**, a very long **time** ago now, about four hundred years ago, lived a prince called Hamlet in a castle in Denmark. (“What is ‘Denmark’?” asked Christopher Robin.\t“It’s a northern European country where you pay taxes up to your nose, and where consequently you have to spend your entire working life at the Tivoli Gardens making giant LEGO figurines of Trolls and Cheese Danishes while drinking lots of beer.”\t“Winnie-the-Pooh isn't quite sure whether he **would** **like** to live there,” **said** Christopher Robin.\t“But I want to listen to the story,” **said** a growly voice.\t“Then I will go on,” **said** I.)\tOne **night** when he was out walking on the castle wall, Prince Hamlet saw a Ghost, who looked terribly **like** his late father, the King of Denmark.\tHamlet wasn’t at all sure about what the Ghost was talking about, so he sat down at the foot of the castle, put his head between his hands and began to think.\tFirst of all he **said** to himself: “My father’s spirit in arms! All is not well. You don’t **get** all this talk about murders most foul and incestuous beds **like** that, just buzzing and buzzing without its meaning something. If there’s a buzzing-noise, somebody’s making a buzzing-noise, and the only reason for making a buzzing noise that I **know** is because there is something rotten in the state of Denmark.” \t(“What is ‘incestuous’?” asked Christopher Robin.\t“Umm --- it’s when your mother sleeps with your uncle, instead of your father.”\t“What’s wrong with that?”\t“Uh --- grown-ups don’t **like** that. You’ll understand it when you’re older.”\t“Oh, it's **one** of those things. Alright. Back to the story.”)\tThen he thought another long **time**, and **said**: “And the only reason for being a Prince that I **know** of is taking revenge.”\tAnd then he **got** up, and **said**: “And the only reason for taking revenge is so I can kill my uncle and my mother.” So he began to pretend to be mad.He pretendedandhe pretendedand he pretended,andashe pretendedhesanga littlesongto himself.Itwentlikethis: To be, or not to be—that is the question:\tWhether ‘tis nobler in the mind to suffer\tThe slings and arrows of outrageous fortune\tOr to take arms against a sea of troubles\tAnd by opposing end them. To die, to sleep—\t“I forgot the rest --- it’s been awhile since I’ve been a schoolboy,” **said** I.\t“Oh, that’s alright. I don’t understand it anyway. Just go on with the story please,” **said** Christopher Robin.\t“Did he **get** to kill his uncle and mother?” asked a growly voice.\t“Well, he did kill his uncle with a sword, and his mother died drinking poisoned wine that was meant for him. But not before he made his girlfriend go mad and kill herself.”\t“But why?” asked Christopher Robin.\t“Umm --- maybe he didn’t mean to make her go mad. But he killed her father and that made her go mad. And then she drowned.”\t“I think this Hamlet is a bad man”, **said** a growly voice.\t“Is that the end of the story?” asked Christopher Robin.\t“No,” I **said**, “the story ends when Hamlet himself dies.”\t“Winnie-the-Pooh doesn’t really **like** this story,” **said** Christopher Robin.\t“Why? It is a good story, isn’t it?” asked I.\t“Because he hasn’t any brain,” answered Christopher Robin.\tHe gave a deep sigh, picked his bear up by the leg and walked off to the door, trailing Winnie-the-Pooh behind him. At the door he turned and **said**, \"Coming to see me have my bath?\" \t\"I might,\" I **said**. \t\"Is that the only story that you **know**?\" \t\"We can listen to something more cheerful next **time**,\" I **said**. \tHe nodded and **went** out . . . and in a moment I heard Winnie-the-Pooh—bump, bump, bump—**going** up the stairs behind him. Winnie-the-Pooh votes for stories about himself against Hamlet because while he thinks that Hamlet is a good story, Hamlet himself is a VERY bad man."

Characters consisting of; Alice, The Mad Hatter, the March Hare, White Rabbit, Queen & King of hearts, the Duchess, the Cards, the Door, the Walrus & the Carpenter, Tweedle Dee & Tweedle Dum, the Door mouse, the Cheshire Cat, and many more. Alice falls down the rabbit hole only to find different unusual objects floating all **around** her as she falls down further and further and further down the rabbit hole. Things **like** chairs books and other items. Then she reaches a room full of doors, there is a key on a table in the middle of the room. She tried the key in every door but none of them worked, until she came to **one** very small door to which the key fit. However she was much to large to fit through the door so she looked **around** for something to make her small. Then she found a bottle with a tag **said** “drink me” which made her small but she forgot the key on the table so she ate a cake that made her large. She grabbed the key than drank the potion again to make her small. Then she walked through the door to wonderland. Then she met the duchess and the March hare, the Cheshire Cat, and the tweedles. Following the white rabbit then she meets the door mouse and the cards with the King & Queen of hearts. Then the queen found her painting the white roses red. Then the red queen tried to kill Alice. Until Alice escapes from wonderland.I don’t believe there was any specific reason this was written. The author was simply an author with an imagination and a dream to bring the impossibly crazy to life. I personally loved this book. The people that **would** **like** this book are people with a large imagination and tons of creativity. That’s why I read Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland."

       "I was sitting on the patio of a bar in Key West Florida. It was August, it was hot. The bar was on the beach where there was lots of sand and water. In the water I saw dolphins and waves. The dolphins jumped and the waves waved.My glass was empty. The waiter walked up to my table. “More absinthe miss?” He asked. “No, I better not. *burp*” I put my hand over my glass “I read somewhere that it can cause hallucinations and nightmares. Just some ice water please.” I **said**. He put and empty glass in front of me, tipped his picture of water over my glass until it was full, at that **time** he stopped pouring. A man I did not **know** walked up to my table and **said** to the waiter “No **one** in Key West is to stop drinking alcohol while they are conscious, you **know** the rules Manuel! Don’t make me repeat myself; did you hear me? Don’t make me repeat myself, it’s annoying.” Manuel rolled his eyes.“I’ll drink to that”. I **said** and held up my glass of ice water to the stranger, then put it to my lips and drank. It was cold. I set it **back** down on the table. “I just finished a book where everyone repeated themselves……drove me to drink!”“Sorry Mr. Hemingway” **said** Manuel “she **said** she wanted ice water, so that’s what I gave her”. A cat ran by, it was fast. “Meow” it **said**. It was orange. “But you **know** the rules Manuel, you **know** the rules.” Repeated Mr. Hemingway “I **know** the rules Mr. Hemingway, how **could** I not? You tend to repeat yourself constantly, it must be all the absinthe…..” muttered Manuel. “What did you say Manuel?” Asked Mr. Hemingway “Nothing” **said** Manuel. “Bring the lady some Champagne **right** away!” **said** Mr. Hemingway. Manuel walked away towards the kitchen.“Who are you?” I asked the man I did not **know**. “Hemingway, you wouldn't happen to be related to the writer **would** you? His book The Sun Also Rises was the book I was just referring to; I don’t remember ever being quite so bored. On the bright side, I think it did wonders for my blood pressure.” I **said**.Dressed in worn khaki shorts and a Hawaiian shirt with **one** too many colors, he stood there at my table and squinted at me, sweat rolling down the sides of his face and into his gray beard. It was hot. He set his drink down on the table, hard, and pulled out a chair and sat down. “May I sit?” he asked as he put his dirty bare feet up on the table and tipped the chair **back**. “Sure, you’re already in the chair. Besides I don’t think it will be long before you fall on your ass.” I **said**, I drank some water, it was cold. “Language! I’m Ernest Hemingway the guy who wrote that boring book” he put his feet on the ground and the chair dropped down with a bang. He put his **right** hand out to shake mine. I stared at it for a while then took it. “Stephanie. Hey, I don’t want to come across as insensitive but aren't you dead?” I asked “Really? I don’t feel dead….at least I don’t think I am.” Said not dead Ernest “Damn! Absinthe lives up to it's reputation.\" I **said** and smacked the left side of my head with my left hand. My head was hard. “Manuel!! Where’s that champagne?\" I shouted in panic. “So” Ernest picked up his drink and drank the whole thing in **one** gulp. “I am **one** the greatest American writers, if not the greatest, everybody says so. And you…..” he paused and pointed his finger at me using the same hand that still held the glass, the melting ice clinked “you didn't **like** the Sun Also Rises?” he asked and set his glass down. “I **know**, I heard the same thing, that you were **one** of the greatest American writers, so imagine my surprise when I didn't love it **like** the rest of the human race. In fact, I really didn't **like** it AT ALL! Please don’t hurt me.”Manuel walked **back** to the table caring the bottle of Champagne and **two** glasses. He sat the glasses in front of us and **went** about the task of opening the bottle. “Thank god your **back** Manuel, I think I’m hallucinating. I hope champagne helps things normalize.” I **said**, the bottle **said** “pop”. “It won’t help because you are not hallucinating.” He **said** and poured the Champagne, he turned and walked off. I picked up the glass and drank. It was bubbly and cold.“What else didn't you **like** about my book?” Asked Ernest “I’m really not comfortable telling you to your face, but, alright” I **said** “I found all the characters to be aimless, unlikable, drunkards that didn't have any idea what to with their lives but travel about the world constantly drunk….which doesn't sound all that bad on the surface, but it was so not interesting.” I **said** “They were so excruciatingly boring that I couldn't even care enough about them to remember who was who.” I **said** “It felt **like** it **would** never end, but when it did end the only thing that I liked about it was the fact that it was finally over. No big payoff to make the boring book worth my **time**.” I sighed and finished off my Champagne, I poured myself and Ernest another glass.“Wow. Sorry you hated it. I suppose you can’t please everyone.” He **said**. “I’ll buy you dinner to repay you for putting you through that”. “That’s not necessary, but I **could** eat. I must bathe first.” I **said**. “Well sure, it is hot after all.” He **said** “Yes, I must bathe you understand? One cannot dine without bathing first, so you will have to wait until I bathe.”“I must bathe. I must bathe. I. must. Bathe.” I **said**.“Now you’re just making fun of me.” he **said**.“Yup……I will make you suffer the way you made me suffer.” I smiled. “Great. I look forward to it.” Said not dead Ernest. We rose to our feet, Ernest took my arm, we steadied ourselves and stumbled off into the sunset.Also reviewed on shelfinflicted "

       " A few years ago my husband was in a van pool. The people in this D.C. bound van pool took turns driving the van while the others rode in the **back**. One **day** my husband's friend was driving and **got** a speeding ticket. (He was **going** 80 in a 65, just **like** everyone does on Interstate 95). Well, the guy was upset that he **got** caught doing what anyone else **would** have been doing if they had been driving so he asked if people **could** help him pay the ticket. My husband was **one** of **two** people in the pool of 15 people that contributed to the ticket. So in thanks for his gesture the friend gave us this book.This book was also featured in the movie Walk the Line. It reads **like** scripture- and has 28 sections on things the people asked the 'prophet' and I'll give you a **little** taste of section 4 entitled Children: You may give them your love but not your thoughts, For they have their own thoughts. You may house their bodies but not their souls, For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams. This Kahlil Gibran was pretty cool in the 50s I guess. His writings are cool now. My mom had a Kahlil Gibran journal she wrote in in the 70s. How cool is that?"

Just as Murder on the Orient Express left me guessing until the final chapter, I had absolutely no idea who was responsible for the murder and mayhem in And Then There Were None. I was honestly afraid that I **would** never find out whodunnit when I reached the end of the epilogue and still wasn’t given any answers. Thankfully answers were provided **right** at the very end of the novel, and I was completely blindsided by those answers.I might only have **two** of her books under my belt, but I already understand why Christie is considered the queen of the mystery genre. She plays things so close to the chest that it’s nearly impossible to guess anything until she feeds you the information you need. It’s amazing to me that books written this long ago can still be so surprising and mysterious and feel so fresh. I might’ve found a new favorite author!For more of my reviews, as well as my own fiction and thoughts on life, check out my blog, Celestial Musings."

       "Written for the Celebrity Death Match Review TournamentI, Marlow, was recently commissioned by Christopher Robin to go into the Hundred Acre Wood to investigate the stoppage of honey exports from the area. It has been rumored that Pooh Bear has become seclusive and was possibly hoarding the honey. I set out on the Storybook River in a rickety steamer. The trip was dangerous and arduous. At **one** point, we were attacked by a tribe of Oompa Oopmas who threw chocolate at us. I immediately realized we steamed into the wrong story and backtracked until we found the tributary that took us into the woods.As we entered the woods it was clear something was horribly wrong. Dismembered heads were positioned down the river. There were heads of a tiger, a donkey, a kangaroo, among others. Eventually a small pig **like** creature rowed up to our steamer. He introduced himself as a emissary of Pooh Bear and seemed to present the bear as a messianic figure. He **went** on and on with a stutter stating that the other animals did not appreciate the bear's power and genius. He had nothing but scorn for Mr. Robin who he saw as an opportunist who kept the bear and the pig from being anything but child-life, thus blocking their potential.I approached the House at Pooh Corner with fear. But when I entered I found Pooh to be very ill. He has appeared to have endlessly binged on his honey supply and had terminal hunny-tummy-itis. We took him **back** to the ship but he expired leaving his last words. \"The horror, The Horror.\" We had no idea was it meant and figured he was just being pretentious.As we left the woods we noticed that, without the influence of the Pooh Bear, the woods was reversing to a wild state. By the **time** we left, the woods were more **like** a forbidding jungle. Afterwards, Christopher Robin appointed a man named Kurtz to return and try to revive the export business but that is another story for another **time**.Win for Heart of Darkness "

       "Re-read 9/9/18. Still probably the best thing ever written. Last New Year's Eve, I was the designated driver for my group of friends. After ringing in the new year with lots of champagne (for them, not for me), I dutifully and responsibly drove them all **home**, making multiple stops all over town. By 1:30am, I had dropped off the last person and was a block away from my own **home** when another vehicle veered into my lane and blinded me with extremely bright lights. I swerved... and hit a vehicle parked on the street that I didn't even see until it was all over. My car was totaled, the car I hit was totaled, I had a broken hand and foot from the airbag and the impact of the collision, and the drunk MFer without a designated driver that caused the entire thing drove off in his not-wrecked white Honda Pilot with a smiley face bumper sticker. One block from my house, damn it. I was pissed. This street is not a through-street; 95% of travelers on this street live in this neighborhood. Once I became mobile again, I became obsessed with finding this asshole. I drove **around** the neighborhood every chance I **could** looking for that SUV. I had fantasies of finally locating him and smashing up the Honda Pilot with my rental car. Then, when he came outside his **home** to investigate, I **would** demolish his hand and foot with a baseball bat and then take off. Truth be told, that was the first fantasy scenario. The more I obsessed about it, the grander the revenge fantasy became. Torches, snakes, and poison were all part of the revenge plot at some point. A few weeks later, I saw it. White Honda Pilot with a smiley face bumper sticker was sitting in the driveway of a **home** a few streets away from mine. I pulled over on the side of the road and sat there for a very long **time** rehashing my revenge plots and figuring out the minute details. Then I started my car and drove **home**. Because revenge is complicated. If I had gone through with the plot, I **could** have hurt myself. I **could** have hurt someone else. I **would** have most definitely received an even larger increase in my car insurance than I was already getting. God wouldn't have been happy with me because of the whole \"Vengeance is mine\" thing. I couldn't bring myself to do it. There **could** only be **one** result of my action or my inaction -- an accident that already happened and increased my car insurance rates. And that's Hamlet in a nutshell. Shakespeare quite brilliantly turned the revenge play upside down. Hamlet, the young man seeking revenge, can't bring himself to do it. Hamlet knew that it was expected for him to seek revenge for an honor code violation, but he also knew that religion opposes revenge and **could** place his soul in jeopardy if he were to carry it out. So, he convinced himself that the ghost of his father might not be real and that he needed more proof. When he **got** his proof, he talked himself out of his revenge plot when he had the perfect opportunity because he convinced himself that killing a murderer while the murderer is praying **would** result in sending the murderer to heaven. He obsessively and continuously overthinks everything, even the fact that he overthinks everything. He doesn't **know** what to do because he realizes everyone is a liar and everyone is hiding something, and he hates that, but he does the same thing in order to figure out what's **going** on. He was driving **around** the neighborhood looking for a white Honda Pilot for the entire play. In the graveyard scene, though, Hamlet finally gets it. There **could** only be **one** outcome whether he took his revenge or not, and that outcome was eventual death. Regardless of what we do or don't do, death is coming for all of us. One **day** we will be nothing but a skull without a tongue with which we can tell our stories. We all need excellent and loyal people for friends who can be our tongues when we are no longer able to speak for ourselves. Long live the Horatios of the world.Hamlet is about the complexities of the human personality: the internal ups and downs, the thoughts that go through our heads when we're trying to sleep at **night**, the constant struggle to figure out wtf we are supposed to be doing. It isn't about a conflict between multiple people; it is about the conflicts we experience within ourselves. No wonder this is thought of as the best thing ever written. It is about putting on **one** face for the world and another for our alone **time**. It is about finding out that people you trust aren't that trustworthy. It is about that search for the white Honda Pilot that ends up with your lying in bed at **night** wondering if you're doing the **right** thing. After all these years, Hamlet is still relatable. Hamlet is all of us on any given **day**. And maybe even every **day**."

       "I forgot to add this to the books that I read in 2017 because I read this on the last **day** of school before winter break and then things **got** extremely busy with Christmas and a surgery that I had 3 days before Christmas. However, I am **going** to add it now because I **got** to read it under very unique circumstances. I was subbing on the last **day** of school before winter break and the entire Jr. High was doing an activity that they call \"A Book In A Day\" and this was the book that the whole school was reading. As a former full **time** Reading/English teacher, I sort of thought this wasn't a very good thing to do on the last **day** because students are really wound up and it's really difficult to keep them sitting for **one** class much less all **day** and reading a Agatha Christie novel even though it is fairly short. Anyway, since I was there, I decided to read too so I **could** at least be a good role model for these kids. There are 7 bells in a **day** and the kids were told to read a few chapters a bell so by the end of the **day**, they finished the book, hence the name \"A Book In A Day\".Ten Little SoldiersTen Little Soldier Boys **went** out to dine, **one** choked his **little** self and then there were nine.Nine Little Soldier Boys stayed up very late; One overslept himself and then there were eight.Eight Little Soldier Boys travelling in Devon; One **said** he’d stay there and then there were seven.Seven Little Soldier Boys chopping up sticks; One chopped himself in halves and then there were six.Six Little Soldier Boys playing with a hive; A bumblebee stung **one** and then there were five.Five Little Soldier Boys **going** in for law **one** **got** in Chancery and then there were four.Four Little Soldier Boys **going** out to sea; A red herring swallowed **one** and then there were three.Three Little Soldier Boys walking in the zoo; A big bear hugged **one** and then there were **two**.Two Little Soldier Boys sitting in the sun; One **got** frizzled up and then there was One.One Little Soldier Boy left all alone; He **went** and hanged himself and then there were none.Anyway, let's **get** on to the review. I realized quickly that I had already read this book in school under the title \"Ten Little Indians\" and had seen the play. It starts out pretty slow with 10 people invited to a private island. Once there, the guests are told that they are all murderers and deserve to die and **one** by **one** they are found dead by the other guests. At this point the book really picks up the pace and I really **got** into it because I just couldn't figure it out! The guests all become suspicious of each other and do everything they can to spot the murderer, but they keep getting killed **one** by **one** until \"Then There Were None\".There are lots of twists and turns and I couldn't remember how the book ended, so I read faster to **get** to the end. Even then it was confusing. There is an epilogue and the detective in the story \"explains\" what happened. At the end of the school **day**, I did explain to my last bell of students who didn't understand what happened, but in general, the kids really liked the book. I was surprised that they liked it! I guess I thought they wouldn't **like** it because it was published in 1939 and kids these days are used to everything faster and scarier. This book doesn't fit that description. So if a 28 student class of 7th graders liked this book on the last **day** of school before a 2 week break after reading all **day**, then Christie's books have stood the test of **time**. I have read other Christie books as well as other Classic British Mysteries and I **would** recommend this to anyone looking for a good read or an intro to Christie. 4 stars."

Matilda.For me, Matilda was a classroom filled with enthralled children, each **one** waiting to hear what was **going** to happen next. It was laughter and tears. It was the way my teacher lifted her glasses with the tip of her index finger and smiled at us before flipping to the next page.It is the way my mom used to read to me.

I fell asleep dreaming of other worlds; of a world where a courageous intelligent young girl such as Matilda outwitted tyrannical oppressive figures such as Trunchbull.So when I was looking for a book to read and my gaze landed on this **one** book, I knew.I knew I had to read it again.

       "I read this in the Frankfurt International Airport during a five-hour layover. In retrospect, it was fitting because I was pretty much among the living dead, operating on close to 20 hours of no sleep after being kept awake the entire flight from the US to Germany by my goddamn seat refusing to lean **back** for the first half of the trip, and then by a goddamn crying baby for the last half. It was a bright and early morning when I mercifully stepped out of the Lufthansa jet, and I was abnormally pissed that so many people were so well rested, despite the crying baby. I was dying for sleep but was afraid to nap because I was pretty sure I **would** sleep for the next ten hours and miss my connecting flight. Of course, I did not pack a book in my carry on, assuming I **would** pass out for the entire flight. Luckily, I had downloaded heaps of open source books onto my phone and randomly chose **one** to read to kill **time**.So I read...and I read...and I read.Even after my connecting flight was called and I checked in, I had my phone in my hand. Even after the flight attendants told me to put away electronics, I read until their nice lilting voices changed into sharper commands of please turn off your handheld device.So yeah, the book was really good. Good enough to keep me awake until my connecting flight finally landed. Good enough to make me prowl the non-English streets of a small French village to hunt down a physical copy of the English book and pay handsome import taxes for it.Oh, what about the book itself? It's about vampires and blood and sexual innuendos wrapped up in Victorian Gothic sensuality. And no sparkling creatures either.Read it. I think you'll **like** it. And if you don't **like** it, at least you can brag about reading it and not liking it."

       "After I first read this book as a young boy I remember distracting my father **one** **day** whilst he was working in his shed at the bottom of our garden. I was about 11 at the **time** and my father was filing away at something in the vice attached to the work bench. I spotted the pincers/pliers in his **old** wooden toolbox and secreted them away in my knitted cardigan, fashion was not a strong point **back** in the 1970's, and I sheepishly snook out without being noticed. That was the beginning of the adventure for an eleven year boy. When I **got** **back** to my bedroom I closed the door and **went** about removing the panel pins from the backing boards at the rear of my wardrobe. I remember it took what seemed to be an eternity and I froze every **time** I heard somebody on the landing outside my bedroom door. Waiting for my mother's voice enquiring what I was up to. It never came and I felt relieved and a great sense of accomplishment when the last pin was removed and I was able to step into my wardrobe and out the other side. I pulled the wardrobe slightly away from the wall and was able to trig the boards **back** in without them falling out. I had lots of fun inviting friends **around** after school and showing them that when I stepped into my wardrobe I disappeared into a portal and into a new world. When my friends opened the door all they saw was some clothes and the backboards. Of course the joke did not last long as children are inquisitive and found out eventually. We had so much fun pretending we stepped through my wardrobe into Narnia. The fun lasted for about **two** weeks before my mother found out and my father reattached the **back** boards. I remember as an eleven year **old** boy my imagination was so vivid. Children **back** then had so much fun creating characters and worlds. Today not so much in this digital world of game boys and mob phones etc. Reading books is all about expanding the mind, food for thought, and I yearn **back** nostalgically to those times. The films based on the books are great but, I personally think the book should be read first.🐯👍"

       "When it comes to whodunit does it **get** any better than this classic from Agatha Christie? Ten people, each with a secret; something to hide, are lured to Soldier Island. They believe they have been invited by some acquaintance. Their host is Mr. Owen, the new owner of Soldier Island. When they arrive they are informed that Mr. and Mrs. Owen have been detained and are not there. After dinner the first evening they are shocked when a mysterious and disembodied voice accuses them, case by case, of crimes which the law **could** not touch.Shortly after the voice has completed his list of charges the first of the ten guests dies. In each of the bedrooms is a copy of a nursery rhyme. In this book it is \"Ten Little Soldiers\". When I was growing up it was more commonly known as \"Ten Little Indians\" (which I believe was the original title of the book). Also, on the dinning room table are ten soldier figurines. One by **one** the guests are killed off. Each **time** it sticks close to the nursery rhyme. And each **time** **one** of the figurines on the dinning room table is removed. With the first **two** deaths the others think it **could** have been an accident or possibly suicide but after the third death it is clearly murder. They have each been marked for death. And normal behavior disappears. They start eyeing each other suspiciously. At first they try to be polite and carry on as normally as possible. But as others begin to die all normalcy soon disappears. They are stranded. There is a storm and they are on an island ... alone. And with a madman whose mission is seemingly to exact justice of his or her own.The story is so well written and the murderer left unknown that Christie had to write an Epilogue, a written confession, to explain how it was done. I believe the author mentioned in her autobiography how pleased she was with this story. I have read this book several times over the years but still enjoy **going** **back** to it and rereading it. “Ten **little** Indian boys **went** out to dine; One choked his **little** self and then there were nine.Nine **little** Indian boys sat up very late; One overslept himself and then there were eight.Eight **little** Indian boys travelling in Devon; One **said** he'd stay there and then there were seven.Seven **little** Indian boys chopping up sticks; One chopped himself in halves and then there were six.Six **little** Indian boys playing with a hive; A bumblebee stung **one** and then there were five.Five **little** Indian boys **going** in for law; One **got** in Chancery and then there were four.Four **little** Indian boys **going** out to sea; A red herring swallowed **one** and then there were three.Three **little** Indian boys walking in the Zoo; A big bear hugged **one** and then there were **two**.Two **little** Indian boys sitting in the sun; One **got** frizzled up and then there was **one**.One **little** Indian boy left all alone; He **went** and hanged himself and then there were none.”"

       " An innovative cover of Frank L. Baum's book.MOST of us have read L. Frank Baum's \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" and have enjoyed it. Many of us have also seen the 1939 film \"The Wizard of Oz\" which has been adapted from the book. So I am not **going** to write a review of the book or provide you any details about Dorothy, her pet dog Toto or any of her friends -- The Scarecrow, The Tin Woodman and The Cowardly Lion. I will just recount to you an incident from my schoolboy days which has great relevance with the book. Pop-up books will always remain popular among children. It was probably the spring of 1966 when I was walking **home** after school on a bright and sunny **day** in Karachi. Sometimes I used to walk on the edge of the street taking the long-way **home** and sometimes I used to cut across a huge grass-less playground. On this **day**, I decided to use the shortcut. As I was walking over the playground, my eyes caught hold of a book lying across my path. I picked it up. It was a cover-less book. Anyway, I took it **home** with me.After changing and having my lunch, I sat on my bed and started reading \"The Wonderful World of Oz\". I was hardly interested in a guy called L. Frank Baum at the **time**. I finished the entire book in **one** sitting, as it was that interesting. Earlier, I had read many story books in Calcutta **like** The Three Little Pigs, Red Riding Hood and Snow White & the Seven Dwarfs, but they were truly short in comparison to this **one** and meant for Kindergarten children. So in a true sense, \"Oz\" became my first schoolboy storybook.  A few months later I moved **back** to Calcutta leaving all my books and comic-books behind. However, whenever I recall as to how I came across this book, I often wonder whether a junk dealer had dropped it from his wooden cart of newspapers, magazines and books or whether some schoolgirl/boy had dropped it from her/his schoolbag. Somehow their misfortune turned out to be my treasure trove and an everlasting memory. An extract from the book. In the late 1990s, I watched \"The Wizard of Oz\" in which Judy Garland played Dorothy. I thoroughly enjoyed myself while watching the film too. I have also seen a couple of other versions of \"Oz\" on film. A film poster of \"The Wizard of Oz\"."

       "I was noticing a new friend’s book shelf and how he likes children’s books just as I do. He had read Alice in Wonderland. I had read it as a child. I ask myself: Did I really **like** that book **back** then? Was it just given to me and that was all I had to read? Did my mother pick my books? And why were they always a certain kind of book, **like** Cinderella and The Wizard of Oz? Why were they not Robinson and Crusoe and Treasure Island? I can’t imagine liking these books now. I don’t **like** fantasy except say for Tolkien, but that may be unfair since I have not really tried any outside of Mockingjay, which I hated, but I read it because I was in a book group, not that I read everything they threw at me, which means I hated most. As to Alice, who cares about a girl who takes pills, and how **one** pill made her larger and **one** pill made her small? The song was good, White Rabbit. Love Minus Zero was a far better song. Maybe this book **would** have been better if written by a hippie. Speaking of which, I was never in to taking drugs in the 60s or 70s. So. as for Alice in Wonderland, I never wanted to read it again or even analyze it to even **know** why the hippies loved the book, or even if they did. Still, I liked the hippies, those **back** to the landers, that is, those who didn't sit **around** stoned all **day**. And **back** to my youth: I read everything. I read labels, cereal boxes, bill boards, and I loved those Burma Shave signs along the highways, where **one** sign **said**: Shave the modern way, and **one** sign **said**: No brush. The next sign **said**, No lather / No rub-in / Big tube 35 cents - Drug stores / Burma-Shave. I say, Who can beat that?When I grew older I always tried to see what a stranger was reading, the book in their hands. Sometimes I **would** ask. When I was in college I began collecting children’s books because I hadn’t read them as a child. Wind in the Willow was **one** I bought, but I never read it. I wondered why my mother didn’t take me to the library earlier in my life and stock me up on children’s books. I grew up with deprivation of environment, I thought. Maybe it was because she had just gone through a divorce when I was 8 years **old** and had to work, **get** her life **back** together. I only remember that as a teenager, we **went** together to the library sometmes. We read Bridey Murphy and Lost Books of the Bible and wondered if reincarnation was real, and why wasn’t Jesus’ childhood in the Bible and where did Cain **get** his wife.And then in my early teens, I found the section of books about mountain people. I have no idea what attracted me to this genre. I do **know** that there was a wonderful librarian, a woman, who, when I came up to the desk and asked for more books on the mountain people **would** lead me to them. And now I **know**, a lightbulb just **went** off in my head. It was her that introduced me to my first book about mountain people. It was The Shepherd of the Hills, and then she took me to The Trail of the Lonesome Pine, or it was the other way **around**. Then came Gene Stratton-Porter, and next it was the Bald Knobbers, and all by myself I found Tobacco Road, which my mother took away, telling me that it was a dirty book. Next, I was reading **one** about the area where I lived, The Salinas: Upside Down River, and years later a friend gave it to me without realizing that I had read it. I **got** into the Nancy Drew and the Dana Sisters next, liking the latter series better. I loved westerns and read most on their shelves. I read about the outlaws and how Jesse James came to Paso Robles where I lived. I read **one** that I **could** never find again: The main character was a sheriff or a marshal, and his name was Jack Slader. I still wish that I **could** find it. Next, I was into the non-fiction books, veterinarian medicine, how to increase your memory and who knows what all. I wanted to **know** everything. I just didn't want to **know** about Alice or Cinderella or even Peter Pan anymore.This reminds me of a older man who used to come into the library who talked with me. It probably wasn’t often, but I knew him just because he was **around**. He told me that he wanted to learn every word in the dictionary and then go on The Millionaire and **get** rich. I thought how good it **would** be to increase my own vocabulary, but it was always so boring, so I never **got** past Aardvark and used to call my brother **one**. If only the other words were just as interesting.Then I met the man who cleaned up the park where the library was located. He showed me the pond with the mosquito fish that was hidden in the trees and gave me some for my aquarium. He showed me pine nuts and **said** that they were good to eat. He even showed me how I **could** find them in pine cones, that is, if the squirrels hadn’t gathered them first. And last of all he showed me how all the trees in the park had name tags in English and in Latin. So, yes, my mother had to work to support us kids, and I heard a lot of “Go out and play,” by my older sister who quit high school to take care of us, and that I did. That part was wonderful because I **could** go anywhere in town, to the library, down to the river with my dog or into the hills where I **would** sometimes come **home** with poison oak. I remember how I explored every shop in town, every corner, every street, even the alleys where people had wonderful gardens. One **day** my friend Mary and I **went** into the Mercantile to try on men’s hats. We told the clerk that we wanted to buy our dads a hat, and the clerk didn’t even care, although we knew that he didn’t believe us. Exploring was fun.But as for this book, I **would** never think to read it again even though I have long missed watching Disney World on our TV on Sundays nights. What do I watch instead, The Walking Dead. My how times have changed."

       "I should point out that I had no expectations when forced recently to go to the Charles Dickens museum in London. The girl who sold us the tickets did nothing to alter my opinion of the writer when she **said** that there was only so much Dickens **one** **could** read. She softened the impact a **little** by pointing out it **would** be a bit of a busman's holiday, wouldn't it? Working there all **day** and then far from escaping when **one** left, **going** **home** to read the blighter.The misguided exploitation in those sorts of places of intrusive audio is a nightmare. It wasn't enough that there were signs on everything 'This was the cutlery they used at dinner', 'This was the bed of Mrs Dicken's' and 'They **would** have used this thing on that occasion'. They had to round it out with sound. 'These are the sorts of sounds that there **would** have been at the dinner table,' 'These are the sorts of sounds Mrs Dickens and her female friends **would** have made when they were sewing'. 'These are the sorts of sounds that **would** have taken place in the nursery.' No area was free from this auditory pollution.If there were any point to being in this place, for me it **would** have been contemplative silence. Imagining what it might have been **like**. But any act of imagination was actively prevented by the insistence on mechanical hypothetical sounds that filled the space of every room.Ugggh."

       "I always thought this was about an unhappy poet married to a philanderer-poet in London in the 1960s. So opening in New York in the 1950s ... **like** some fabulous and fun episode of Mad Men ... was a beautiful surprise.And it's so funny! Sad, of course. But there's a wicked sense of humour here.\"New York was bad enough. By nine in the morning the fake, country-wet freshness that somehow seeped in overnight evaporated **like** the tail end of a sweet dream. Mirage-grey at the bottom of their granite canyons, the hot streets wavered in the sun, the car tops sizzled and glittered, and the dry, cindery dust blew into my eyes and down my throat.\"\"A girl lives in some out-of-the-way town for nineteen years, so poor she can't afford a magazine, and then she gets a scholarship to college and wins a prize here and a prize there and ends up steering New York **like** her own private car.\"\"My dream was some **day** ordering a drink and finding out it tasted wonderful.\"\"'What do you do?' I asked the man, to break the silence shooting up **around** me on all sides, thick as jungle grass.\"\"Doreen **went** flying up on his shoulder, and her glass sailed out of her hand in a long, wide arc and fetched up against the pine-panelling with a silly tinkle.\"\"They had the windows fixed so you couldn't really open them and lean out, and for some reason this made me furious. ... I **could** see down to where the UN balanced itself in the dark, **like** a weird, green, Martian honeycomb.\"\"a cup of over-stewed coffee so bitter it made my nose curl\"\"The cab driver took the corners with such momentum that we were thrown together first on **one** side of the **back** seat and then on the other. Each **time** **one** of us felt sick, she **would** lean over quietly as if she had dropped something and was picking it up off the floor, and the other **would** hum a **little** and pretend to be looking out of the window. ... There is nothing **like** puking with somebody to make you into **old** friends.\"\"his days of glory shrunk to a **little** gold cup on his mantel with a date engraved on it **like** the date on a tombstone.\"\"When Constantin asked if I **would** **like** to come up to his apartment to hear some balalaika records I smiled to myself. My mother had always told me never under any circumstances to go up with a man to a man's rooms after an evening out, it **could** only mean **one** thing.'I'm very fond of balalaika music,' I **said**.\"\"Mr Willard eyed me kindly.... 'Nelly and I have always wanted a daughter.'For **one** crazy minute I thought Mr Willard was **going** to announce that Mrs Willard was pregnant and expecting a baby girl. Then he **said**, 'But I don't see how any daughter **could** be nicer than you.'\"\"I'm not sure what I expected of Buddy's sanatorium. I think I expected a kind of wooden chalet perched up on top of a small mountain, with rosy-cheeked young men and women, all very attractive but with hectic glittering eyes, lying covered with thick blankets on outdoor balconies.\"\"On every side of me the red and blue and white jacketed skiers tore away down the blinding slope **like** fugitive bits of the American flag.\"\"After a discouraging **time** of walking **around** with the silk cord dangling from my neck **like** a yellow cat's tail and finding no place to fasten it, I sat on the edge of my mother's bed and tried pulling it tight.\"\"darkness wiped me out **like** chalk on a blackboard.\""

       "Fiesta: The Sun Also Rises **could** be read **like** it's some kind of evil social experiment. You take a room and you put in three elephants. (You may also choose to build the room **around** the elephants for practical reasons.) You give the elephants names, and paint these names on their flanks in letters big, bright and red. You call them Impotence, Jealousy and Loneliness. Then you have a group of people enter that same room, a couple of guys and a gorgeous girl. They can do anything they **like**, they **get** the freedom to do anything they want. The only rule: They are not allowed to address the elephants in the room. To make things more interesting there's an open bar and all the liquor in the world. Sounds **like** a party alright. Except, it didn't read **like** a social experiment to me. It didn't on my first reading, and it didn't on my second. So yeah, **time** for some creative writing and dramatisation! __________First Reading - ViennaThe academy hallways were full of sound. The sun blasted through my window, the room was hot. I **got** off the bed, splashed some water on my face and headed out the door. The hallway was white and cool. Familiar faces were smiling at me and at each other. Bags and suitcases were strewn all over and I made my way to the big stairway. I hugged some people. Students were returning from the summer holiday, they were in good spirits. I had stayed over summer. An internship had kept me in Vienna and in the academy for the hot season full of tourists. I saw David. He was talking to some people and I headed over to his group. He had come from Canada and looked pretty tired. His checkered shirt was wet under his arms. \"Hey man! You had a good flight?\"\"Yeah, pretty beat. Going for a quick nap.\"\"You're up for drinks later?\"\"Sure.\"He **went** up **two** flights of stairs. The other students had started up their own excited conversation about their summer holidays so I decided to head down, into the garden. It was surrounded by the white architecture of the academy. Some trees stood huddled up in **one** corner, a bench overlooking a green lawn sat in their shade. Lucian was reading a book.\"Hey.\"\"Hey, **old** sport. Had a good summer?\"\"Yeah, Vienna is swell in summer. A lot happened.\"\"Nice. Weren't feeling too lonely then?\"\"No, not too much. She's been really nice, you **know**.\"\"Who?\"\"Are you up for drinks later?\"\"Of course.\"\"You see Andrew yet?\"\"No and I haven't heard him all summer.\" \"Me neither. Doesn't surprise me.\"\"Yeah.\"\"Will be good seeing him again.\"\"Yes.\"He continued to read and I **went** **back** up my room. It started to cool off a bit outside so I opened my window to let in the fresh air. I tried to read a bit but my stomach hurt. I hadn't eaten well in the morning, just a biscuit and some yogurt. I lay face down on my pillow and sighed. The breeze coming from outside stroked the **back** of my neck and my hair. Voices and laughter came from outside. My stomach ached. I woke up a couple of hours later. The Gymnasium next to the academy had blocked off the rays of the low-hanging sun from our garden. It was thrown in grey shades and a fresh silence. I took a sip of water and **got** changed. As I headed out I saw David on the stairs. \"Let's go?\"\"Yes sir, I was just on my way.\"\"Not too tired?\"\"A bit, I **got** me a bit of the **old** desynchronosis.\"\"I see you're still sleeping with your thesaurus.\"\"What? It's a normal word.\"We **went** through the big wooden door of the academy, out in the street in the evening sun. We turned away from it walking eastward towards Karlsplatz. A small, white church lay at the end of the street. It was closed. It had been all summer, as far as I **could** tell. We passed by it, crossed a busy street with a tramcar and saw a red bus parked in the street ahead. The owner of the bar had bought a British double-decker. Signs were put on its windows advertising book readings for children. The \"Lesebus\", Johnny chose to call it. The pub's terrace sitting in the double-decker's shade was full of people. We **went** in and saw Lucian sitting at **one** of the tables. He was writing something down in a notebook before he looked up and saw us coming. \"Good evening, **old** chaps!\"\"Good to see you again, Luke. What are you having?\"\"Kilkenny.\"My stomach ached.\"What about you, Matt?\"\"Yeah, same thing.\"David **went** to the bar to order. A line of people had formed, their places were being reserved outside on the terrace. Nobody seemed to anxious, it was still early. Most of the noise came from outside, some of it drowned out by the rock music coming from within. \"Did you see her yet?\"\"Didn't see anyone I **know** since I **got** here, just Jake behind the bar. Asshole.\"\"Yeah, he's an asshole.\"\"So, how are you?\"\"Alright, you **know**, a bit rusty on the drinking. I don't drink as well as you guys.\"\"You're a poor drinker.\"\"Give me tequila or vodka and I'll handle it. Did you see Andrew yet?\"\"You're a poor drinker.\"\"I don't drink beer very well, that's all. Must be the fermentation stuff or whatever. Did you see Andrew **around**?\"\"No. Probably didn't **get** **back** from England yet or he'd be here. Man loves a drink more than a momma loves her babies.\"\"What are you writing?\"\"The usual. I've been reading a great book. Hemingway. Fiesta. You **know** it?\"\"I can't say that I do. Just started reading you **know**. I'm now in the middle of \"A Confederacy of Dunces\".\"\"Now there's a funny book. You should try Fiesta.\"David came **back** with three glasses. \"Cheers, guys.\"\"Hey David, did you read Fiesta?\"\"Hemingway? Sure! Great book.\"\"She's such a bitch, **right**?\"\"Yeah.\"\"What a bitch.\"\"Yeah. And such poor sods too.\"\"Hey, don't spoil the book guys, I haven't read it yet.\"\"Don't worry, it's not a spoiler. It's pretty obvious from the **get**-go. She's a bitch.\"\"Yeah. Poor devils. I've never been to Spain. Maybe next summer.\"\"It's nice. I'm not too crazy about their bullfights, but their food is excellent. They **got** these big, dried hams everywhere.\"\"Bull ham?\"\"Ham doesn't come from bovine creatures Matt.\"\"I **know**. I was in Barcelona a couple of times, good place. The sea, the city, it's **got** it all. Good place.\"\"We should go to Barcelona together, have a party. We'll have a blast.\"\"Isn't it pretty to think so?\"\"Yeah. You guys want another beer?\"\"You didn't finish yours yet.\"\"You **know** I can't keep up.\"\"Keep up.\"\"I can't.\"\"Keep up, you bastard.\"\"I'll finish it on the way.\"I stood up, picked up my jug. Lucian gave me a dirty look. David rubbed his face and looked at the wall. I **went** to the bar and stood in line. People were pushing against me as I was finishing my beer. It was hot. Sweat was running from my forehead, irritating my eyes. Things were getting blurry. \"What will it be?\"\"Hey Jake. Three Kilkenny please.\"\"Big ones?\"\"Big ones.\"He handed over the beers. I handed over the money and told him to keep the change. It was a big tip.\"Have you seen her?\"Jake didn't hear me. He was already looking over my head towards the next customer.I returned to the table. David had pulled out a game of cards. \"Why aren't they here?\"\"Who?\"\"Andrew.\"\"I told you, he's probably still in England.\"\"Everyone returned today. I'm pretty sure he's in Vienna. Why isn't he here?\"\"Maybe he's tired? I **know** I am. Wanna play?\"\"And why isn't she here? She's normally always here on Tuesday nights.\" \"Wanna play?\"\"No.\"\"Play.\"\"I don't feel **like** it.\"\"What's up, Matt? You can't handle beer, you don't want to play. Had a rough summer?\"\"I had an excellent summer.\"\"Great to hear it! Cheers!\"\"Cheers guys.\"\"Cheers!\"\"Now let's fucking play.\"She hadn't come. I had heard a noise from Andrew's room before **going** **back** to mine. I didn't turn on the lights but walked to my bed and fell face down on my pillow. I punched my mattress. My knuckles were burning. My stomach ached. __________Second Reading - BrusselsWe're lying in bed. It's getting dark outside but the street is still alive with sounds of children playing. It's a hot summer **night**, holidays are almost over. She's playing with her phone. I'm reading the last pages of Fiesta.\"Isn't it pretty to think so?\"I close the book and put it on my **night** table. I turn off my lamp and **get** ready to sleep.\"Going to sleep already?\"\"Yeah, pretty tired.\"\"Did you finish your book?\"\"Yeah.\"\"Was it any good?\"\"It was excellent.\"\"Nice. Good **night**, my love.\"\"I love you.\"\"Me too.\"I closed my eyes. I felt myself slipping into a deep sleep. I felt strange dreams lying in wait for me behind a cold veil of darkness. She stirred, turned her **back** to me. I turned on my side and opened my eyes. She glanced sideways, looking up. I took her by the shoulder and gave her a kiss. I lay **back** down and drifted off."

       "And Then There Were None, by Agatha Christie has a special way of getting under my skin and making me look over my shoulder the way all good suspenseful psychological murder mysteries will do.And Then There Were None begins in the heads of ten strangers who are journeying to spend **time** on Soldier Island after each receives a carefully worded invitation to spend various amounts of **time** on the island. None of the travelers seem to have any real idea of who will meet them, and each only vaguely knows or remembers the friend from whom they have received their correspondence – but they have heard rumors about an actress that may or not own the property, and wild goings on there. Each has a strong motivation for wanting to be anywhere but **home**.The visitors to the island are surprised to realize that neither host nor hostess are on the island, and when a terrible recording comes on a dinner announcing crimes that each of them have purportedly committed, mysterious deaths start to occur. It doesn’t take the group long to figure out that they have been lured not only to the island but to their death. They also realize the murderer has to be **one** of them.Each of their bedrooms contains a framed copy of the nursery rhyme:Ten **little** Indians **went** out to dine;One **went** and choked his **little** self and then there were nine.Nine **little** Indians sat up very late;One overslept himself and then there were eight.Eight **little** Indian boys traveling to Devon;One **got** left behind and then there were seven.Seven **little** Indian boys gathering up sticks;One chopped himself in half and then there were six.Six **little** Indian boys playing with a hive;A bumblebee stung **one** and then there were five.Five **little** Indian boys **going** in for law;One **got** in chancery and then there were four.Four **little** Indian boys **going** out to sea;A red herring swallowed **one** and then there were three.Three **little** Indian boys walking to the zoo;A big bear hugged **one** and then there were **two**.Two **little** Indians playing with a gun;One shot the other **one** and then there was **one**.One **little** Indian boy left all alone;He **went** and hanged himself...And then there were none.The beginning of the novel bored me a bit as all the characters were being introduced, they were hard to keep track of. I was actually a **little** grateful when some of the characters were picked off because it was quite hard to keep track of all of the stories. It was interesting to watch the events unfold because I didn’t **like** any of the victims, and the terror come from imagining yourself in their position more than from actually caring about them. I wanted to see who was next and in what unexpected way their murder **would** occur.This book has a terrifying premise, and Christie proves to be the master of suspense – she is able to build the spine tingling factor in spite of a rather implausible plot. Would you really go traipsing off to some island without talking to your host? Without knowing them really well? Without having spoken to them in years? All of these folks do and while I didn’t buy it at all, it doesn’t matter and the story works anyway. I was on the edge of my seat the entire **time** that I was reading this.I’m not sure if this is **one** of these novels where you actually have the clues to figure it out beforehand. I had a strong suspicion though. The manner in which the killer is revealed did leave something to be desired, but the beauty of what Christie accomplished with this **one** still remains intact and is definitely worth a read.My Rating--4.5/5"

       "This has always been **one** of my favorite childhood stories. Reading it as an adult, I almost loved it more. It made me realize how much this book shaped a part of who I am. Growing up, I lived in a house that was on a canyon at the end of the cul-de-sac. You **could** walk along the canyon’s edge just beyond our house, and there was a small, U-shaped inlet that was full of wild native plants. Pretty much from the first **day** we moved into that house this **little** inlet (completely hidden by the hedge on our property line) became my ‘secret garden.’ One of the nicest things my Dad did for me as a child was that he cut a hole in his hedge so that I **would** have my own private entry into the garden (grown-ups **could** just use the walking path). I had smaller versions of gardening tools, and I cultivated my own **little** garden of wildflowers. I kept thinking about this as I reread the book, and thought of the other message that I didn’t necessarily pick up as a child: the message that being active and out of doors is necessary for a child to be healthy and thrive. Basic and obvious, yes, but that message stuck with me more as an adult, as so many of our friends start families and we start thinking about having our own **one** **day**. I started thinking about how kids today don’t spend as much **time** outdoors (I don’t blame them, per se, there are a lot of reasons). And I hoped they **would** find the magic in the book (and the surprising complex character development) that I found I loved even more as an adult. On the **day** I finished the book, I had just come in from spending three hours in the backyard of our (new to us) fixer-upper **home**. I had been pruning our beautiful, mature orange tree that was overhanging onto the neighbor’s yard (and pushing on the **back** fence to the point that I thought it might break it), as well as pruning our lemon tree, both of which had been neglected for years. It was difficult work – sawing the limbs off with **one** hand, holding the limb in the other hand so that it didn’t drop in the neighbor’s yard when sawed, only then to have to pull the heavy, fruit-laden branches **back** over the fence onto our side of the yard. But it felt so good do it, even though I was getting scratched by branches and covered in dust and dirt and insects. I stood on our **back** porch when it was all done and **could** see how much better our yard looks. It was so nice to see the results of hard work tangible in front of you. And I thought of the book and hoped that I **could** instill this same love into our kids some **day**. "

You sit wrong! You look wrong! You speak wrong! You are wrong all round!”And my personal favorite. The Trunchbull, feminist icon?“Would you **like** to hear the song about ‘difficulty’?\"\"I should be fascinated,\" the Trunchbull **said** in a voice dripping with sarcasm.“Here it is,” Nigel **said**.“Mrs D, Mrs I, Mrs FFIMrs C, Mrs U, Mrs LTY.That spells difficulty.”“How perfectly ridiculous!” snorted the Trunchbull. “Why are all these women married?”Anyway, this is a terrible book to read before bed.

       "CELEBRITY DEATHMATCH REVIEWSWINNIE THE POOH vs. HAMLETIn a darkly-lit conference room, in a secret hidden fortress complex deep under the waterways of Venice, Italy, a meeting of the most horrible minds on Earth convenes.Patrick Bateman (of American Psycho fame), Jar-Jar Binks, Dick Cheney, Satan, and Mr. Burns (of The Simpsons fame). Sit nervously **around** a table.Satan: It’s been fifteen minutes? Do you think he’s coming?Dick Cheney: He always does this… he makes us wait just to show us who’s in charge.Jar-Jar Binks: Me’s a-scared…(The door opens, and the backlit silhouette Winnie the Pooh appears in the door. The members **around** the table stand at attention as Pooh slowly walks to a chair at the head of the table, which is larger than all the other chairs. He sits, pauses for a second to see that the others are still at attention, and then makes a motion for them to sit.)Pooh: I hereby convene this meeting of the Council of Hideous Atrocities. (bangs gavel) It has been many long years since the planets were last in the proper alignment for us to meet. Each of you must now inform the others of what you have done lately to make the world a more horrible place. (motions to Bateman)Patrick Bateman: I **went** on a senseless killing spree in New York City, **back** in the 1980’s, terrorizing the entire population.Pooh: Excellent!Mr. Burns: Hey! That’s my line.(Pooh returns the comment with a melting stare)Mr. Burns: Eh…uh… please use it at your will, my Dark Master.Pooh: (returning attention to Bateman) You haven’t done anything since the 80’s? That’s very poor, Patrick. You’ll need to step up your efforts to cover lost ground.Patrick Bateman: (bows head low) It shall be done, my Dark Master.Pooh: (to Dick Cheney) What have you done, Dick?Dick Cheney: (smirking proudly) How about **two** wars and the construction of a domestic police state?Pooh: Is that it?Dick Cheney: Oh, and I also gave the My Little Ponies syphilis!Satan: You mean you injected them with a bacterial fluid, or you just…Dick Cheney: I just…(everybody **around** the table winces)Dick Cheney: Don’t judge!Pooh: Okay.. That’s kind of creepy, but… keep up the good work. Jar-Jar, what did you do?Jar-Jar: Me’s-a totally ruined **one** of the most beee-loved movie franchises in history.Pooh: I heard about this.. Star Wars, **right**? Those first three were just fantastic. How **could** you ever ruin such a wonderful story.Jar-Jar: Oh, you’za **know**…. Stupid slapstick jokes, juvenile humor to make everything seem stoop-id.Pooh: Wow.. I’m impressed! What are you **going** to do next?Jar-Jar: Me’za auditioning for the role of Michael in a remake of The Godfather.Pooh: Oh, Man… good luck, my brother!(turning now to Satan)Now… remind me again who you are…(Suddenly Hamlet and Superman break through a wall)Hamlet: EVILDOERS, YOUR TIME IS UP! IT’S TIME TO PAY THE PRICE!(Hamlet plunges his sword into Mr. Burns’ heart. Meanwhile, Superman takes Jar-Jar Binks by the throat and starts punching him in the head violently over and over again. Jar-Jar’s head is a bloody pulp, and Superman ignores everything else **around** him and just keeps maniacally pounding Jar-Jar’s head.Satan starts to run away, but Hamlet jumps on his **back** and reaches into his pocket, producing a vial of poison. He puts the cap in his mouth and uses his **one** free hand to unscrew it. He then pours the elixir into Satan’s ear. Satan falls dead. Winnie the Pooh has flown upward through the ceiling, and appears to be making an escape. Hamlet turns to Patrick Bateman and Dick Cheney, pulling a shrink-ray gun from his pocket, he shrinks them down to ¼ inch each.)Hamlet: (to Superman) Hey, Supes! Enough with Jar-Jar! I think Winnie the Pooh is getting away!Superman looks up for the first **time**, then flies over to Hamlet. Hamlet jumps on his **back** and they fly through the hole in ceiling, pursuing Winnie.(cut to next scene- Winnie the Pooh flying through the sky)Superman, Hamlet on his **back**, catches up to Winnie. Hamlet leaps from Superman’s **back** onto Winnie the Pooh’s. He pulls out a knife and puts his arm **around** Winnie’s neck, pulling up on Winnie’s neck to expose his throat. With the other hand, he puts the blade to Winnie’s neck.Hamlet: Your days of spreading evil are over, Pooh Bear!Winnie the Pooh: (laughing) GO AHEAD AND DO IT! MY STUFFING IS LACED WITH ANTHRAX! IF YOU SLIT MY THROAT, IT’LL FALL DOWN OVER ALL THE WORLD, CAUSING A GLOBAL PLAGUE… JUST LIKE I WANTED TO DO ALL ALONG! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!Hamlet: Thanks for telling me! Take over from here, Superman!Hamlet jumps off Winnie the Pooh’s **back**. Superman grabs Pooh firmly and flies them both in a suicide path into the sun, where both are consumed in a tiny **little** fizzle.(cut to scene on the ground; Hamlet is in a parachute, landing into a crowd of adoring fans! A band begins to play. James Bond runs over to Hamlet, obviously smitten with a severe man-crush on him.)James Bond: THAT WAS AWESOME! THAT WAS THE MOST AMAZING THING I’VE EVER SEEN! YOU MUST GET ALL THE CHICKS!! CAN WE HANG OUT TOGETHER SOMETIME, PLEEAASE?Hamlet: (grabs Ophelia, a totally slammin’ 38-22-36 supermodel in a super-skimpy thong bikini, who starts kissing him all over) Sure, James Bond, maybe sometime… but **right** now, I gotta take care of some business with Ophelia here… “If you **know** what I mean!”(Hamlet winks into the camera)(fade out)MATCH POINT: HAMLET"

       "The TransformationWhen I decided to re-read this novella, perhaps for the second or third **time**, I started to wonder whether the first sentence was its best feature. Then, as I delved deeper into it, it seemed that Gregor's transformation into an insect or, more precisely, a beetle mightn't be the only transformation with which Kafka was concerned.And this speculation led me down the following path, albeit this story based on Kafka's words is set much later in **time**...The MetamorphosisAs Gregor Samsa awoke **one** morning from uneasy dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed. His limbs ached, he had an extreme fever, his throat was so sore he **could** neither swallow nor vomit, and a few lesions had started to show on the edge of his lips and jaw. He was so weak, he couldn’t lift himself out of bed in order to **get** ready for work. Initially, he was more worried about his parents and sister, Grete, because they depended on the income from his work as a commercial traveller.When his manager at work phoned to enquire about his whereabouts, he couldn’t take his call. Instead, his mother apologised that he was too sick to go to work, and **said** that she hoped he **would** be alright in a few days. During his five years of employment he had not been ill once. Gregor hoped the manager **would** show some understanding. Instead, his good record seemed to raise the manager’s expectations. We don’t have anybody to replace him, he **said**, and we’ll be losing money every **day** he’s off. We can’t subsidise malingerers.When Grete came in with his breakfast, she looked at the marks on his face, and **said**, I think we should call a doctor. His mother replied, we can’t spend money on a doctor we don’t have. It’s all **right**, mother, **said** Grete, I’ll pay.The doctor couldn’t come until 10am, which was OK, because Gregor **went** **back** to sleep, as best he **could**, given the pain in his **back** and limbs.The doctor took his parents aside after a brief examination, and **said**, we need to **get** him to hospital for some more tests. I think he might have AIDS. Gregor’s father exploded, no son of mine **could** possibly have AIDS. He’s a hard-working young man. Besides, we don’t want the neighbours to find out.Faced with this obstruction, the doctor had no choice but to leave. As he **went** through the front door into the hallway, he remarked, if you don’t **get** him to a hospital, I’m afraid he might die.Ridiculous, **said** his father.Gregor resumed his sleep and didn’t wake again until after the others had finished dinner. He stood up and walked into the bathroom to look at himself in the mirror. Now, for the first **time**, he understood what the doctor had been saying, but he dropped the mirror on the floor. On the way **back** to his bed, he stood on a shard of glass, and he started to bleed uncontrollably.Grete came into his bedroom when she heard the crash of the mirror. She helped Gregor **back** onto his bed, and proceeded to bandage his foot. You’ll be OK, she reassured him.Gregor’s cut started to heal, but his other afflictions did not. Within a week, even Grete was afraid to enter his bedroom, except to bring him his meal. Neither of his parents had come in since the doctor’s visit. They had been transformed.The next **time** Grete came in, he asked her to stay and play some music to him. She was a talented violinist, and Gregor had been saving money up to pay for her fees at the Conservatorium. Grete burst into tears. Oh, Gregor, I can’t stand to see you suffer any longer. We have to **get** you to the hospital. I don’t understand why mother and father object. I don’t want to lose you.Soon he discovered that he was unable to move a limb. His whole body was aching, but he still thought of his family with tenderness and love. In this state of vacant and peaceful meditation he remained until the tower clock struck three in the morning. A few hours later the first light of dawn entered his consciousness once more. Then his head sank to the bed of its own accord, and from his nostrils came the last faint flicker of his breath.When Grete entered with his breakfast, she felt his pulse and yelled into the darkness at the top of her voice, He’s dead, dead and done for.Gregor’s parents rushed in, but they were almost relieved to learn that Gregor had died. Now nobody need find out what had been wrong with him. Soon, life **could** go on as normal. Only without their son."

During a lapse in judgement I decided to give Mr. Albom another shot by listening to The Five People You Meet in Heaven on CD while I was out and about running Christmas errands. I knew I was in trouble as soon as the countdown to the end of Eddie's life began. Each five minute increment was pronounced with a drumbeat and surge in the music: \"Eddie's last half-hour\" Buh dum. \"Eddie's last fifteen minutes\" Buh dum. \"Eddie will be dead in thirty seconds\" Buh dum.When I wasn't rolling my eyes, I was laughing with contempt at the contrived relationships and the forced dialogue. I **know** that Mr. Albom is trying to create a nice, feel-good way to encourage his audience to seize the **day**, to look for connections with the people in our lives, both close and distant.

       "Celebrity Death Match tournament versus The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.The Twisted SistersI was worried about my colleague, the great respected private detective Sherlock Holmes. The pressure to uphold his reputation was great. He was up at all hours of the **night**, often muttering to himself that this or such and such was \"Elementary, my dear Watson\" and ways to upstage me in games of Trivial Pursuit. One evening I caught him with an opened second box of the game and he was memorizing the questions and answers. To let him save face I pretended that I did not see and feigned awe and worship of his mastery of the game. \"My dear Mr. Holmes, your pursuit of this game is anything but trivial!\" One **night** after he mixed up note cards of a taped episode of Jeopardy! he left to walk the block of Baker Street. I assume he also wanted to smoke a pipe. His housekeeper had been applying the pressure about the bad smell and ill health effects. It was not easy to be Mr. Holmes and I tried my best to solve all of his cases for him. I **would** leave open pages of relevant newspaper articles or historical facts, highlighting the portion that pertained to the case. Sometimes I **would** fake his handwriting and write who did it and leave it on his dressing room mirror. I **would** smile as he berated me for not guessing the obvious clues. He was a great man and I was only doing what any good friend **would** do. I knew that Macbeth and his bitch wife were responsible for murder and tomorrow I **would** allow Mr. Holmes to put them behind bars. I **would** **get** him **back** into his warm bed if I had to **get** in it with him myself.That particular evening my friend did not come **home** in **time**. I found him again in the den of the psychic hotline sisters. \"Sex me! Sex me! You foul temptresses... I think I want the blonde tonight...\" I'm an accepting friend, truly I am, but these women were not even hot. By rights they should be giving quarter hand jobs behind the local pub.\"Fair is foul, and foul is fair: Hover through the fog and filthy air! You have been smoking again.\" The **one** with the heaving cleavage was uttering these words as Holmes nestled his unshaven face between the twin bosoms. \"If you notice, the left is larger than the **right**...\" He drunkenly muttered.\"Mr. Holmes, I have come to take you **home**. You cannot afford their prices. That is how we ended up taking the diamond caper case and that nearly **got** us both killed.\"\"Mr. Watson, you are a wet blanket.\" He might have **said** something else. He was slurring his words at this point. He had called me a wet blanket another **time** but to understand you **would** have to **get** the context. It is elemental, not elementary.\"These bitches cannot solve our cases. It is much too perilous! The correct answer will come to you in the morning, as it always does. True genius should not be rushed.\" Egos such as Mr. Holmes needed to be boosted. It was a tough world we lived in. Prostitutes **like** these charged too much! (The red head had laughed at me and **said** I couldn't even watch for a few lousy quid.) Was nothing free anymore? Before my marriage, I **would** stumble into any rest stop and find a willing young man. Alas!\"I can handle a **little** peril... I am...the...great...Sherlock Holmes!\" He had passed out. I **could** not **get** him moved by myself. The brunette was unbuttoning my pants and the redhead had my wallet. They had found the diamonds I had stolen from the bank to create the diamond caper case. A new and mysterious fourth woman was drawing on my face. She looked familiar. The photos of the Macbeths in my wallet! Too late. I hope it is a dignified mustache, this **time**.When I woke up I was in jail for murder and last I heard Mr. Holmes was a security guard at a shopping mall. Macbeth and his whore wife were living it up in Bermuda. Hand jobs in prison cost a lot. Damned inflation...Winner: Macbeth"

       "A grim play, but keep the context: written under the new Scottish King James whose wife Anne of Denmark laughs at anti-Scottish jokes. Recall, too, that the Master of the Revels had to approve all plays prior to performance. By 1605 the Court out-lawed Scottish jokes on stage, which must have disappointed Queen Anne. Remembering this history, perhaps MacBeth is **one** long Scottish joke. I had a comm coll student who had been kicked out of his house, lived in the backyard for a month or more, who loved the play. By the **time** he was in my class, he'd lived in shelters (mainly for pot, as I recall) and gotten on his feet. We attended the play in Newport*, in a stone barn, guardhouse to **one** of the mansions, that then did a couple Shakespeare plays off-season, often with a Trinity Square (Providence) actor directing. The barn was down Bellevue Avenue from Salve Regina College. Rereading it this week, just came across the witches’ section he loved, “Double, double, toil and trouble,**/ Fire burn and cauldron bubble./ Fillet of the fenny snake/...Eye of newt and toe of frog, / Wool of bat and tongue of dog...” Great recipe, almost equal to the cabbage and carrot Vodka Salad I read on Pravda **two** days ago. This **time** through I conclude it has fine, burning poetry, though uncharacteristically humorless for Shakespearean tragedy. Think of Hamlet on Polonius, “[He’s] at supper, M’Lord. Not where he eats, but where he’s eaten. E’en now a convocation of politic worms are at him. The worms your only emperor of diet. We fat all else for us, and we are..food for worms.” * He loved it so much he hitch-hiked **back** the next weekend, with a friend, but the fools wouldn’t let him buy tickets. No idea what he’d been through--and that he knew the witches’ speeches better than they. Turned out okay: he and his friend walked the Cliff Walk by the ocean before the hitch-hiked **back** to Fall River. ** Be careful to avoid, \"Double double boil and bubble\"--that's for a New England boiled dinner."

       "When I was a junior in college, our English Dept opened up a new class: Literature of the Vietnam War. I needed an elective credit, and I knew next to nothing about the war, so I signed up for the class, which was held once a week, at **night**.The class was half-full, and I was **one** of three females taking the course. I sat regularly next to a man who had actually served in Vietnam, and when he talked about his experiences, I felt puny, as though I didn't belong. I stared frequently at the top of my desk, worked quietly through our first book, some correspondences from a helicopter pilot. And then, we **got** to Tim O'Brien. We read The Things They Carried and I fell hard. We read Going After Cacciato, and I fell harder. I read and I wrote and I lit up with the reading and the writing, and then, **one** **night**, the professor asked me to stay after class. I was confused. Why did he want to speak to me? The class emptied out and I approached his desk, and he handed me **back** **one** of my papers and stared at me. He had actually written \"A+\" on the front of my essay, and I alternated between looking uncomfortably at my grade and at his unswerving stare at me. Finally he **said** something about my paper being excellent, but that he was most interested in the passion I had for the subject. I looked at him again, wondering if he was yet another creepy male professor trying to ask me out for \"coffee,\" but I **could** see by his eyes that he was not. He was the real deal, another nut job **like** me, who is in it for the stories.It's been years, and I can't remember exactly what he **said**, but he ended up telling me that he had been reduced to begging the college for years to open this class, and that none of them had been sure of what to expect, but, after reading my paper on Tim O'Brien's books, he knew that it hadn't been a mistake to offer this as a subject.He **said** something **like**, \"I read your paper, and I **could** see that you GOT it. You totally GOT it, what the Vietnam War was and is for people.\"And, again, it's been years, so I can't repeat what I answered **back** then, but I just re-read The Things They Carried this week, and I can say now. . . How can you read Tim O'Brien and not GET the Vietnam War?"

He **said**, \"Hey man, you gotta read that. My dad told me when he first read that book, he'd take **two** hits of acid, read a chapter, and then take **two** more hits of acid. He didn't leave the house for a week.\"It's still the most memorable pitch for a book I've ever heard.Turned out, that kid was a huge reader. Gave me lots of great book recommendations."

       "11/10 **would** recommend :)A joke about the Lost Generation told by Woody Allen, when he used to do stand up comedy:”I was in Europe many years ago with Ernest Hemingway. Anyway, he had just written his first novel, and Gertrude Stein and I read it and we **said** that it was a good novel but not a great **one** and that it needed some work, but it **could** be a fine book. We laughed over it and Hemingway punched me in the mouth.That winter, Picasso lived on the Rue de Bac, he had just painted the picture of a naked dental hygienist in the middle of the Gobi desert. Gertrude Stein **said** it was a good picture but not a great **one**, and I **said** it **could** be a fine picture; we laughed over it and Hemingway punched me in the mouth.I remember Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald came **home** from their wild New Year's Eve party. It was April. Scott had just written \"Great Expectations\". Gertrude Stein and I read it and we **said** it was a good book but that there was no need to have written it because Charles Dickens has already written it. And we laughed over it and Hemingway punched me in the mouth.That winter we **went** to Spain to see Manolete fight. To me he looked 18 and Gertrude Stein **said** no, he was 19, but that he only looked 18. And I **said** sometimes a boy of 18 will look 19 , whereas other times a 19 year **old** boy can easily look 18, that's the way it is with a true Spaniard. We laughed over it and... Gertrude Stein punched me in the mouth.\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEsFb..."

       "\"The Summoner\"A friar goes into a town looking for goods to give to the church. He spotted a house that he had stopped at before and always gave willingly. The Friar talked to the man (who is in a wheelchair) and his wife. The wife offered the friar something to eat. The friar told her that he **would** love something, but nothing needed to be killed on his account; but if she truly wanted to she can. The wife greets the friar and talks about how the last **time** the friar visited her son died not too many days later. \t\tThe wife **went** to cook the friar his meal leaving the man and the friar alone. The man then talked about some sort of treasure that he possessed. The man **said** nobody knew about it or that he had it, not even his wife. The friar asked if he **could** see this treasure he was speaking of, he of course was always looking for a **little** extra to take **back** to his congregation. The man told him to go under his blanket and near his rear and to feel for it. The friar so curious and greedy did as he was told. Once he stuck his hand under the blanket not feeling anything at all the man farted on his hand. The friar was angry and embarrassed about what had happened to him. Later the man and friar meet in town to explain to the townshpeople how the poor friar had been duped by the man. \tWhen they **got** to town the man was telling people why he did it. He felt that the friar was not using the donation he received to the best interest of the congregation. To better illustrate his explanation the man asked someone to sit on a wagon wheel and to fart in the center of the wheel. Upon doing so the man in the chair told everyone that even though he only farted in the middle hole all of the slots where the spokes sat had a stench coming from it. \tThe moral of the story is that even though you only hurt **one** person that **one** person may hurt more and have the ripple down affect.  I **would** recomend this story to somone who likes humorous tales."

Anyway, we were hanging out at T.'s house and she and I were talking and totally ignoring him.She looked me up and down and I felt really uncomfortable being scrutinized, then **said** that she didn't think my name suited me. I had always hated my name (I've **got** **one** of those super common late-70s names, for realsies - it was the most common female name the year I was born) and when she told me that I seemed more **like** a Matilda to her, I was thrilled.I even let her make me over and **would** spend Sunday nights at her house (our school started 2 hours later every Monday) and she'd curl my hair and dress me up (oh, because WE WERE THE SAME HEIGHT AND BOTH HAD GIANT FEET) and [gasp] put makeup on me.Those Sunday nights/Monday mornings where I **got** to be Matilda were some of the only good parts of that year, and every **time** I see this book, I think of her.Of COURSE I was a huge Dahl fan when I was growing up, and I empathized so hard with **little** Matilda, whose parents were total selfish assholes. How I longed for a Miss Honey in my life.[sigh]Oh, and if you're interested you can hit the spoiler tag for **one** of the few photos of me at that age that I don't actually hate.(view spoiler)[Actually, I had to remove the photo cos some weirdos were looking at it too much and ended up using most of my screencast bandwidth.

       "This is a sad book. The author intended for it to be sad. He researched the material before he started writing, he lived among the migrants and watched how they had to live and survive. I enjoyed the book for several reasons. I was born 20 years after the book was written. We still drove those Packards and **old** Fords. My family was poor. Dad worked hard to provide and Mom was wonderful at making everything count. I think she **could** cook with nothing, make clothes and toys out of anything. We lived in Colorado and occasionally we **would** travel to Texas or Kentucky to see my Moms family. There were six of us, seven after my baby brother was born. We **would** all pile into our wonderful **old** car, taking our food and water with us. Dad was the only driver and when he **would** **get** tired he pulled over on the side of the highway and we all took a nap sitting in our seats. When we **got** hungry we **would** stop and have a picnic with the food we had brought with us. These were the days before interstate highways and when we needed gas we **would** stop at **little** service stations along the way. The attendant **would** fill the gas tank, check the oil and wash the windshield. My grandparents had the **old** way of talking much **like** the Joads. The other thing that made this book enjoyable to me was the fact that I have been to, or close to, nearly every place mentioned in the book. I live in Kansas now and was surprised to see Galena mentioned, it’s just down the road a piece. I connected with a lot in the book and it made it a sweet read for me. But it is a sad book and I didn’t care much for the ending, even though the author meant for it to be sad, I wish he hadn’t left the family stranded in a flooding rainstorm. Steinbeck had a poetic way with words and the book is beautifully written."

The whole atmosphere, they carried it, the humidity, the monsoons, the stink of fungus and decay, all of it, they carried gravity. They moved **like** mules. By daylight they took sniper fire, at **night** they were mortared, but it was not battle, it was just the endless march, village to village, without purpose, nothing won or lost. They marched for the sake of the march. They plodded along slowly, dumbly, leaning forward against the heat, unthinking, all blood and bone, simple grunts, soldiering with their legs, toiling up the hills and down single abiding certainty that they **would** never be at a loss for things to carry.[W]hile Kiowa explained how Lavender died, Lieutenant Cross found himself trembling. He tried not to cry. With his entrenching tool, which weighed 5 pounds, he began digging a hole in the earth. He felt shame. He hated himself.

Apparently Linda thought it was a silly question. She smiled and **said**, \"Do I look dead?\" I told her no, she looked terrific. I waited a moment, then asked again, and Linda made a soft **little** sigh. I **could** smell our wool mittens drying on the stove. For a few seconds she was quiet. \"Well, **right** now,\" she **said**, \"I'm not dead. But when I am, it's **like** ...

I brought it along for a second try on a cross-country drive, and cracked it open as we entered Oklahoma. Obviously that enhanced my connection with the story, but the real reason this book deserves its Classic status is that the characters are sharp and tragic. (Always true of Steinbeck, by the way.) Dive deep into the Grapes of Wrath, and do it when it's hot out. Do it when you want to think about what America means. Do it in a car, or at least look out at cars from your window.

       "Ten **little** Indian boys **went** out to dine; One choked his **little** self and then there were nine.​​No wonder this is considered to be the best book of Agatha Christie's ever - it is truly a masterpiece. Nine **little** Indian boys sat up very late; One overslept himself and then there were eightAnd I am not just saying it- I truly mean it. I didn't just discovered it and am not speaking on a high rush of that fresh new read feeling - this was a re-read for me. And I don't re-read books very often - only the BEST OF BEST makes my re-reads list. Eight **little** Indian boys travelling in Devon; One **said** he'd stay there and then there were seven.​If you have read anything of Agatha Christie before and wasn't a big fan - read this. This novel is completely stand alone and it doesn't feature Miss Marple or Poirot, **like** all of her other books do. Despite being first published in 1939 this novel is timeless, it reads extremely easily. It's an absolute CLASSIC without that heavy classic feel. Seven **little** Indian boys chopping up sticks; One chopped himself in halves and then there were six.The book starts out with clever introductions to our 10 characters all of whom intertwine somehow on the way to the Soldier Island, to where they were all invited. And then - and then shit goes down! Six **little** Indian boys playing with a hive; A bumblebee stung **one** and then there were five.Christie plays with human psyche and emotions wonderfully in this book. She brings out guilt, paranoia and distrust. It's so tangible you can almost feel it seeping through the pages. Five **little** Indian boys **going** in for law; One **got** in Chancery and then there were four.I have mentioned that this ia a re-read for me. I read this for the first **time** about 5 years ago (at least) and because of this I couldn't really remember what happened. So, reading it again felt new and exciting! BUT, I also feel **like** even if I remembered the ending I'd still have enjoyed it just as much. Because then I'd have just looked for clues, for giveaways and hints on how to solve the mystery. Four **little** Indian boys **going** out to sea; A red herring swallowed **one** and then there were three.This book is **one** of my all **time** favorites, and to be honest not many books can beat that. I always find something to dislike if I read books more than once (as the more I read the more critical I **get**). Three **little** Indian boys walking in the Zoo; A big bear hugged **one** and then there were **two**.I found some things that I didn't think clear answers were given to in the book, but nothing major, and nothing that **could** have disappointed me. For this read focuses on atmosphere, on emotions and on quick pace of events that just don't give you **time** to catch your breath. Or to put the book away...Two **little** Indian boys sitting in the sun; One **got** frizzled up and then there was **one**.And because it is so atmospherically mysterious and creepy, it's a perfect October read! Highly, highly recommend! Bravo Agatha Christie, BRAVO!One **little** Indian boy left all alone; He **went** and hanged himself and then there were none.My WEBSITEMy INSTAGRAMMy WORDPRESS BLOG"

So I wound up with memories of reading \"A Farewell to Arms\" and John Greene's \"Paper Towns\" in OBX. But that called up memories of not having a place to sleep, since all the families that paid their share of the beach house already had a bedroom and my mom and Ed's room was full with all three kids, so I spent the nights drinking enough beer and wine that I **could** sleep anywhere. I felt welcomed but distinctly separate. Anyway reading this book was a treat and the ending left me as hollow as it did that first **time** I read it in OBX."

Nothing noteworthy I'm betting since there are already over 5000 reviews here on Goodreads.Two things only:1-The Shining is **one** of the few books that have ever freaked me out. Yes I read it as a teenager, but some of the images (the bloated dead woman in the bathtub) still stick with me.2-I've been to the \"Overlook Hotel\" (actually The Stanley Hotel) on a number of occasions; once with the intended purpose to **get** a \"vibe\". I sat alone at the bar, drinking my whiskey, running words through my mind and writing them down until the sun was well set and I began to worry about getting up. I was at that stage of inebriation where my feet couldn't be wholly trusted.I then **went** alone in search of something scary.There are guided tours of The Stanley and I kept well away from them and instead **went** to the darker, lonely areas of the hotel. After nosing about for the better part of **two** hours, I was in the lower ballroom when I made my discovery: this placed sucked! It was simply crawling with tourists. They came out of the woodwork **like** inquisitive, nattering , bespectacled roaches. Their presence spoiled my vibe. It wasn't just their humanity, it was their middle-class, annoying humanity--their cameras, and their plaid shorts and their cell phones they couldn't seem to let go of that made me want to pull down **one** of the fire axes hanging from the wall and go all \"Jack Torrence \" on them. I touched an axe. It was cool and polished and perfect. I couldn't stop touching it. The more I saw the tourist roaches the more the axe begged for me to hold it.I realized then that I had discovered a new vibe. One in which the smooth handle of an axe soothed the turbulence running amok in my mind and created a serenity of silence and blood. Lots of blood..."

       "How does **one** review a book so unusual? Michael wondered.This raw food diet still had everything inside churning **like** the clothes as they spun **around** the driers. The clinks as buttons slid along the metallic sides, the rasp of the air conditioner that was never turned off because it didn't work at all anyway, the light coming through the pain of the laundry room's **one** small window, as Michael looked out upon the shimmering light that hit the water of the swimming pool, always clean, always ready for someone to dive in, despite the mid-December chill in the air, despite the fact that not a toe **would** touch that water for months. Michael scratched his nose with his **right** index finger. He didn't **know** how to review Mrs. Dalloway.But isn't that always the challenge with good books? With those books that open their eyes and meet yours head on; where an exchange is made; those books that take something from you, and give you something else in its place, your spleen now in the book, a glowing white light in its place. What does that even mean, he wondered? Can **one** give **back** to a book? Or does **one** only take? Does **one** only \"give **back**\" by paying the author for the text? What a cold process that seems. But, what can someone give to a book that has been **around** for nearly a century--the author's cells now broken apart from **one** another and spread about, either throughout the dirt **around** the space where her coffin once was, or still locked away inside (and let it be known, Michael thought once again, that I never want to be put inside of a coffin; I'd rather be experimented upon, or used by Von Hagens in **one** of his exhibits)--what can **one** contribute to a work that has been declared Permanent, a diamond that will not age as **time** passes, **like** The Illiad,, **like** Othello, The Portrait of a Lady, or Confessions of an Heiress? Perhaps if I hadn't eaten so much crappy food before switching my diet, I wouldn't be rushing out of the laundromat every half an hour to take a dump, Michael thought. After finishing laundry, he decided he **would** take the light rail to campus and finally buy his school books. He didn't **know** why, but the trip on the light rail from **home** to campus was something he still looked forward to, even after taking it dozens of times: there was nothing he **could** put his finger on regarding the experience that was noteworthy, yet he smiled as he thought about the trip. Was it the mythical stature he'd given to education that made this trip enjoyable? The pilgrimage to a place of learning, the journey towards knowing? But, he'd come to terms with the fact that none knew, truly; all viewed the world through their own terministic screens (he enjoyed working terms he'd learned from grad school into his thoughts, though he'd feel **like** a jackass to drop them into conversation). Everyone had a socially conceived network of abstract notions through which every flower, airplane, stray dog had to be filtered before it registered in the mind. We place forms upon everything, when there is truly no division. He **went** next door to the gym, because he couldn't hold it any longer. Again, there was nobody working out, although the television that hung from the ceiling was playing some soap opera, the six fans that swayed dangerously as they whirled above the workout equipment. How much power is wasted every **day** to keep a city humming incessantly? Could we not leave the television off, the fans off, the lights off, until someone came in to actually use the facilities? Couldn't the air conditioner be turned off during the winter, or taken out, since it does fuckall anyway? (Joy often laughed at him when he used British words, **like** fuckall and rubbish.) Like many times in the past, he wished he **could** live somewhere that stars were clearly visible. He remembered driving through the expanses of New Mexico, the lights from the cars the only things breaking the darkness, hindering the starlight. Perhaps, instead of **going** with Joy out to the casino this weekend, they **would** drive far out of the city and do some star gazing. The starry sky, **like** chasing fireflies in the summer, was something from a collective childhood he tapped into occasionally during reveries; he was born in a big city, and moved to another, yet pined for both fireflies and starry skies. But he couldn't stand the thought of living outside the city--there was fuckall to do out there. After finishing his movement, and washing his hands for forty five seconds, he left the gym and walked past the swimming pool. One of the neighborhood's many stray cats slunk along the beige fence **like** a secret agent, half-hidden by the flowering bushes. The sky was Arizona cloudy, which is called Mostly Sunny anywhere else; a sweep of clouds covered half the sky, while the rest was entirely blue. It was a beautiful **day**, December 29th of 2010.He **went** **back** into the dim, florescent light of the laundry room. Opening the thick book he'd brought with him, he thought again about all the reviews he still needed to catch up on. And he still didn't **know** how to review Mrs. Dalloway. And he was totally at a loss about how to review Orlando, but he put that out of his mind as he gazed down into A People's History of the United States. His eyes met Howard Zinn's, and he resisted the urge to look away."

Gandalf arrives at Minas Tirith to warn Denethor of the attack, while Théoden musters the Rohirrim to ride to Gondor's aid. Minas Tirith is besieged. Denethor is deceived by Sauron and falls into despair. He burns himself alive on a pyre, nearly taking his son Faramir with him. Aragorn, accompanied by Legolas, Gimli and the Rangers of the North, takes the Paths of the Dead to recruit the Dead Men of Dunharrow, who are bound by a curse which denies them rest until they fulfil their **long**-ago forsworn oath to fight for the King of Gondor. Following Aragorn, the Army of the Dead strikes terror into the Corsairs of Umbar invading southern Gondor. Aragorn defeats the Corsairs and uses their ships to transport the **men** of southern Gondor up the Anduin, reaching Minas Tirith just in **time** to turn the tide of **battle**. Éowyn, Théoden's niece, slays the Lord of the Nazgûl with help from Merry. Together, Gondor and Rohan defeat Sauron's army in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, though at **great** cost.

Merry with his sword killed the Nazgûl who charged upon them after killing the King of Rohan. After the **war**, the injured were taken for healing. Merry, Éowyn and Faramir were healed by Aragorn. Sam found Frodo in the tower where Orcs had taken him. He was naked so Sam found him some Orc clothes. Then they went on with their **journey** and reached the Mount Doom; Gollum followed them there too. He fell in the fire while he was snatching the Ring from Frodo. The realm of Sauron ended with the Ring. Aragorn became the King and Faramir his steward. Gimli and Legolas as they promised each other went together to lands of Mirkwood and beyond before going to their own respective people. The hobbits met Bilbo at Rivendell but he decided to stay there. So Merry, Pippin, Sam and Frodo went **back** to their Shire which was captured by Saruman who named himself as Sharkey. Worm tongue killed both Lotho and Saruman. Sam married Rosie and settled in Bag End. Frodo finished the book Bilbo had given him at their parting. Frodo met others on his way to Rivendell, together they went to Havens on their ship, as their **time** and duties had come to an **end**."

Set during the Trojan War, the ten-year siege of the city of Troy (Ilium) by a coalition of Greek states, it tells of the battles and events during the weeks of a quarrel between King Agamemnon and the warrior Achilles.Characters: Ajax, Odysseus, Helen of Troy, Menelaus, Paris, Hector, Achilles, Agamemnon, Aeneas, Sarpedon, Priam, Cassandra, Patroclus, Diomedes, Ajax Oileus, Andromache, Briseis, Hecuba, Nestor, Akhilleusتاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز نخست ماه ژانویه سال 1973 میلادیعنوان: ایلیاد؛ شاعر: هومر؛ مترجم: سعید نفیسی؛ تهران، بنگاه ترجمه و نشر کتاب، 1334؛ در 720 ص؛ موضوع: داستان جنگ تروا - سده 08 پیش از میلادعنوان: ایلیاد؛ شاعر: هومر، مترجم: میرجلال الدین کزّازی؛ تهران، نشر مرکز، 1377؛ در 579 ص؛ شابک: 9643053865؛ چاپ دوم 1381؛ چاپ پنجم 1385؛ چاپ ششم 1387؛ شابک: 9789643053864؛ موضوع: داستانهای کهن از نویسندگان یونانی - سده 08 پیش از میلاداثر حماسی از «هومر»، شاعر نابینای یونانی ست، داستان جنگ «تروا»، بخاطر ربودن «هلن»، زن زیباروی «منلاس»، یکی از فرمانروایان یونان، به دست «پاریس» پسر «پریام»، شاه «ایلیون (تروا)» است، خواستگاران «هلن»، باهم پیمان بسته بودند، که چنانچه گزندی به «هلن» رسید، شوی او را برای مکافات مجرم یاری دهند. از اینروی سپاهی بزرگ، به فرماندهی «آگاممنون»، و با حضور پهلوانانی همچون: «آشیل»، «اولیس»، «پاتروکل»، «آیاس (آژاکس) »و... آراستند، و به سوی شهر «تروا» روانه شدند، تا «هلن» را از «پاریس» بازپس بگیرند. سپاهیان یونان، ده سال «تروا» را محاصره کردند، ولی با رشادتهای پهلوانان «تروا»، به ویژه: «هکتور» بزرگترین پسر شاه، و برادر «پاریس»، و پشتیبانی خدایانی همچون: «زئوس»، «آفرودیت»، و «آپولون» طرفی نبستند. در آن سالها «آشیل»، بزرگوارترین پشتوانه ی یونانیان با «آگاممنون» اختلاف داشت، جبهه را رها کرده، و در گوشه ای، به همراه یاران خویش، نبرد را تماشا میکرد. تا اینکه «پاتروکل» پسرعموی «آشیل»، با لباس و جنگ ابزار آسمانی «آشیل»، به نبرد رفت. ولی با نیرنگ «زئوس»، و دشمنی «آپولون»، و دیگر خدایان هوادار «تروا»، «پاتروکل» شکست خورد، و به دست «هکتور» کشته شد. «آشیل» از آن رویداد خشمگین شد، و اختلافش با «آگاممنون» را کنار بگذاشت، و پس از تشییع جنازه ی «پاتروکل»، به نبرد تن به تن با «هکتور» پرداخت، و او را شکست داد. سپس به جنازه ی «هکتور» بی احترامی روا داشت، و آنرا با خود به اردوگاه یونانیان آورد. «پریام» شاه «تروا»، به یاری خدایا،ن شبانه خود را به اردوگاه «آشیل» رساند، و با زاری از او درخواست کرد، که جنازه ی پسرش را به او برگردانند، تا بتواند مراسمی در خور بزرگی پهلوان حماسه ساز ترتیب دهد. پس از گفتگوی بسیار، «آشیل» پذیرفت. داستان «ایلیاد» اثر «هومر»، با توصیف سوزاندن «هکتور» در «تروا»، و به سوگ نشستن مردمان شهر، برای «هکتور» به پایان میرسد. در کتاب: «ایلیاد»، و همچنین در کتاب دیگر «هومر»: «اودیسه»، هرگز اشاره و سخنی از نحوه ی پایان نبرد «تروا»، و سرنوشت تراژیک «آشیل» نیست. داستانهای «اسب تروا»، در آثار نویسندگان رومی، همچون: «ویرژیل»، و «اووید» آمده است، و افسانه ی رویین تن بودن «آشیل» و ماجرای پاشنه ی «آشیل» او را نیز، که به مرگش میانجامد، شاعر «رمی سده ی نخست میلادی: «استاتیوس»، در کتاب خود با عنوان: «آشیلید»، برای نخستین بار آراسته، و به آن داستان، پرداخته است. ا. شربیانی"

       "Pippin and Gandalf have made their way to Gondor, to share the heart-breaking news of his son’s death with Denethor, the Steward of Gondor, whose heart has already found this grief, and mind is being devoured by despair. Merry has joined with the renewed King of Rohan, who has joined Legolas and Gimli in their **battle** to save Gondor and fight for **men** against the amassed armies of Sauron. Aragorn will go to the Paths of the Dead and have a secret force join with his to destroy their enemy before he will claim his rightful throne as King of Gondor. And Frodo and Sam are alone, in the tower of Cirith Ungol, narrowly escaping the vicious spider Shelob, wearily darting around orcs and another following shadow, as they make their final **journey** to the fires of Mordor where the ring was crafted.To **many**, all seems lost and hopeless. But there are those who would go to the **end**, no matter where the path leads. Though none of the former company could have guessed most of the sorrowful ends their friends and homes have come to. But with the destruction of evil comes hope, and a chance for rebuilding and regrowth.The Return of the King, the last leg of the **journey** of the One Ring is hopeful, rewarding, and highly informative, with even added appendixes to tell of what happens with Aragorn, Samwise, and the rest of the company who remain in Middle Earth. This book is a necessity for all who’ve begun the trilogy, following along with the **journey** of the weary travelers, as it is the satisfying ending of all who hoped to see good triumph over evil, and the hopes of Middle earth restored.For discussion questions, similar reads, quotes, and a recipe for White Cupcakes of Gondor with Vanilla or Almond Frosting, visit: http://hub.me/amNDo"

       "Prince Caspian by C.s.lewisThis was the **one** I was waiting for. Not because of what I heard or the film of the same name (that I haven’t seen). No, instead this is the quality of writing and storytelling I had heard of about C.S. Lewis. This book was so vast and detailed. The furry little talking critters of book 2 are **back** and so is Narnia. The daughters of eve and the **two** sons of Adam return to find their kingdoms **long** passed and now run by a usurping **king** ruling over everyone. They are tasked with bringing him down and putting a new and frightful heir on the throne. A classic tale that any child should read. My only regret is not reading the original trilogy in their originally written order. Great **story** that continues on in three more books. "

       "Mandelbaum's translation of The Odyssey is easily among the best of all **time**. He doesn't just translate the words. He has the heart of a poet, and it shows in his delicate treatment of the original source material. This book deals with a minor character from The Iliad, Odysseus, who is traveling home with his army after helping the Greeks to defeat the Trojans. Odysseus angers Poseidon by blinding his son, the cyclops Polyphemus. Poseidon requests permission from the other gods of Olympus to destroy Odysseus. However, Athena cares greatly for Odysseus, because she appreciates how cunning of a warrior he is. So, at the insistence of Athena, Zeus commands that Poseidon cannot kill Odysseus. However, Zeus allows Poseidon to punish Odysseus for a period of ten years. The book deals with the adventures Odysseus and his crew encounter as Poseidon blows their ships all over the sea. Odysseus' crew is all killed off during these adventures and Odysseus returns home to Ithaca to find his palace has been taken over by rich and lazy suitors who, believing Odysseus to be dead, are attempting to gain the hand of Penelope, Odysseus' wife. Together with his son, Telemachus, Odysseus plots to kill all the suitors who are taking advantage of his lands, animals, and servants. In the **end**, Odysseus reclaims his kingdom and finishes a **journey** that started 20 years prior when he left for Troy.Mandelbaum's verse translation is so beautiful in it's language that it is difficult to put it down, even for a minute. This is how the Odyssey was meant to be read."

In his own words: \"… **man** can be destroyed but not defeated.\" Like Dr. Rieux and his friends in Camus's The Plague, struggling with the plague, while people continue to succumb to the disease. Perhaps Hemingway has seen enough death and destruction while reporting on the Spanish Civil War to understand that at times, a person can only fight without the hope of victory, and he or she must choose either to give up, or to fight and be destroyed. In his novel, For Whom the Bell Tolls, Robert Jordan, in accepting the assignment to blow up the bridge, knows he wouldn't survive the task and he didn't. Still, he, like Santiago, chooses to fight.

       "If Indiana Jones had fought in the Trojan War, his trip **back** home to Ithaca might have looked a lot like the 10-year **journey** that Odysseus experienced! I read the Iliad earlier this summer (and reviewed it here as well), and rediscovered why it is such a classic. And, now, likewise with The Odyssey, which I loved even more! Here is the epic **story** of Odysseus, a valiant hero who fought in the 10-year **long** Trojan **war**. When the **war** ended, he encountered obstacle after obstacle, and only after another incredible decade passed did he get home.Telemachus, the only son of Odysseus, was an infant when his father left for the Trojan **war**; the theme of family love and honor runs strong in the Odyssey, as Telemachus, now a young **man**, sets out to discover whether his father (whom he has never known) is dead or alive after these 20 years have passed. Meanwhile Penelope, the wife of Odysseus, is besieged by dozens of suitors, who assume Odysseus is dead. They spend their days at the home of Penelope, eating her food, drinking her wine, and generally being a selfish nuisance.And, oh, the challenges Odysseus faces in his 10 year **journey** home! The crafty nymph Calypso, who holds him captive for years; the giant Cyclops Polyphemus who imprisons Odysseus and eats some of his crew; the Sirens who tried to enchant him into shipwreck; Scylla and Charybdis, with whom Odysseus faced an impossible choice; the Lotus Eaters, the Laestrygonians, and so **many** more! With wits and clever trickery, and courage, and bravado, Odysseus (a la Indiana Jones) faces the **many** challenges, and survives. He, for instance, escapes the sirens by having his crew tie him to the mast of the ship; he tricks the Cyclops, and the crew escapes by clinging to the underside of sheep. His shrewd mind, along with the help of the Gods, finally brings him home to Ithaca. After being disguised for a **time** (part of his strategy), he reveals himself and destroys every last **one** of the evil suitors.There are **great**, overarching themes in the Odyssey: Honor, courage, determination, the love and importance of family, the rewards of loyalty, and others. You will not soon forget the loving, devoted faithfulness of his swineherd Eumaeus, or the tearful scene with Odysseus and his old, sadly neglected dog (who was a puppy when Odysseus left for Troy), or the joyous reunion of Odysseus with Telemachus and Penelope. A classic **story** no **one** should miss!"

What follows are **many** chance meeting and renewed allies. Pippin and Merry aided the Ents, tree herders in their decision to go to **war**. The riders of Rohan and their **king** were aided by Pippin, Merry, Legolas and Gandalf against the orcs. Contemporaneously as **many** battles were held at Helm’s deep and Isengard, the ring-bearer Frodo and Sam were able to sneak their way closer to their destination, Mordor. Lost as Frodo and Sam were, they found a guide in the disguise of Gollum. Gollum led through **many** dangerous places which Frodo and Sam would not have escaped on their own accord. Along their **journey**, they found and unexpected ally in Faramir, Boromir’s younger brother. Faramir aided the hobbits and warned them of the passage which Gollum wishes to take the hobbits to. The passage is rarely used or known and holds a guardian. Gollum leads the hobbits to the passage without telling the hobbits of the guardian, as he will wants the One Ring. In the events that follow, Sam is forced to make a dire choice."

       "I have read Homer before but reread it recently to rediscover the wonder of the Greeks and Trojans, Achilles, Agamemnon and Hector. It is a delight to wonder at the Gods and mortals and the role of fate in their enterprise. This mythic epic still speaks to us more than twenty-five hundred years after it **first** began to be recited by the poet Homer. After withstanding the rage of Achilles, the Greeks go up against the Trojans led by Achilles friend Patroclus. But, fate has decreed and with Apollo's help Hector brings the final blow down on Patroclus. At this point you realize why this poem has been read for millenia and loved by **many**. But just as touching, perhaps more moving are moments like the **one** described in the epigraph above. For in the next book as Menelaus leads the Greeks to retrieve Patroclus body and the Trojans **battle** the Argives we are told of Achilles' horses who \"wept from the **time** they had **first** sensed their driver's death,\" (lines 493-4, p. 456). This brings home the momentous occasion of Patroclus' death in a way that transcends the **battle** scenes and suggests it is the fabric of their life that has been rent - not just another **battle** death.Achilles takes his fight to the Trojans as Book 21 of the Iliad begins with the Trojans routed, **one** half blocked by Hera with the other half \"packed in the silver-whirling river,\" (line 9). Achilles slays Lycaon, son of Priam, and Asteropaeus, son of Pelegon. Then he goes after the Trojan's allies from Paeona, beating and hacking them \"in a blur of kills\" (line 235). The blood of the **men** is so thick that the river rose. But Achilles proceeds to attack and fight the river itself. Continuing until the gods recognize that this cannot stay. Poseidon and Athena come to him and advise him, \"It's not your fate to be swallowed by a river:\" (line 328). The gods take over from this point and the book chronicles the spectacle of battles among the gods, mirroring the battles of the **men** below. even through this the river remains a thread that cannot be forgotten. The Trojan's and Hector's days in particular are numbered from this point onward.The final book of The Iliad begins with the games over and the armies scattered, but Achilles remains in grief over the death of his friend Patrocles. He slowly is persuaded that he must return Hector's body to Priam. Even as his mother Thetis mourns the future fate of her son who is **also** doomed to die, the gods gather and continue to argue over the situation."

       "A **great** follow-up to The Iliad, The Odyssey is a different type of book altogether. While The Iliad is a true **war** epic, The Odyssey is a traveler's tale and a testimony to the wits and tenacity of King Odysseus and his wife and son. Its been ten years since the **end** of the ten year **long** Trojan War, and Odysseus is the only King who has not yet returned home. His son Telemachus has reached the cusp of manhood without knowing his father, but the keep is overrun with young suitors who are set on marrying his still-youthful mother Penelope. They eat Odysseus' flocks and drink his wine and party in his house, constantly flirting with the maids and demanding that the Queen choose **one** of them to marry, now that her **long**-lost husband has been gone nearly **two** decades. With inspiration from a god, Telemachus embarks at last on a **journey** to discover what the fate of his father was.From here, we catch up with Odysseus, caught in the midst of a **long** and treacherous **journey**, from which only he will return among his **many** ships of warriors. Oddysseus, shrewdest among the cunning and no mean warrior in his own right, must use every skill he possesses to make it home alive, in spite of demons, monsters, evil **men**, and vindictive gods. And once he gets there, he has to figure out how to win **back** everything he owns and everyone he loved.As I read The Odyssey, I was reminded of all sorts of fiction that reflects the themes of this timeless tale. The earlier parts of Odysseus' **story** read like Gulliver's Travels, while the latter are reminiscent in some respect of Robin Hood and **many** Grimm tales. The **story** is **also** related in a fascinating way glossing over huge swaths of interesting plot between this **story** and The Iliad. Toward the **end**, I found myself thinking of how greatly Tolkien was inspired by tales like this **one**. If you like Lord Of The Rings, you'll find something to enjoy here."

       "For a review of TLOR in general read my review of The Silmarillion. These are some additional thoughts on issues taht come up on the books. On page 277 Tolkien recounts the reforging of Narsil, Aragorn’s sword, which he renames Andruil, Flame of the West. The sword is made by elvish smiths who alone have the skill to remake the sword and pour into it the magic that it needs to accomplish its mission. Elvish swords are mentioned throughout the book as being imbued with special powers. Elvish blades are able to effect creatures that regular blades cannot, for example: when the troll attacks the fellowship in Moria, Boromir slashes him with all his might but his sword just glances off the trolls skin. The significantly smaller Frodo then stabs the troll and cuts him with his elvish blade. Later Sting will again cut Shelob, a powerful creature that only can be threatened by elvish blades. The idea of magical swords made by magical smiths comes from a rich tradition in Medieval literature.\tRegin, the blacksmith from Vulsunga saga, was the brother of a dragon, and learned how to forge magic swords from the dwarfs. Regin takes the shards of Sigurd’s father Sigmund’s sword and reforges a sword for him called Gram which is the only **one** that can kill the dragon Farnir. This **story** is very close to the **story** behind Aragorn’s Narsil-Andruil. There is **also** Hrunting, from Beowulf, which is given to Beowulf by Unferth to slay the mother of Grendel. Hrunting had a hilt with the names of its lineage inscribed upon it. When it melts in the **battle** Beowulf finds a sword made by giants of old that does the job. There is Roland’s Durendal from the Song of Roland, Ogier the Dane’s sword Curtana was said to be reforged from the steel of Durendal, Fergus mac Roich’s blade Caladbolg, Waldere’s Mimming was made by the legendary smith Weyland (who **also** made Beowulf‘s armor); and Arthur’s Excalibur given to him by the Lady of the Lake.\tTolkien’s use of swords in LOTR is in perfect harmony with the mythic literature of the Middle Ages and the special importance people put on well forged swords.

And when all the soldiers get drunk in celebration of Grendel's demise, momma comes tearing into the mead hall and tried to fuck their shit up! Alas she only manages to get **one** of the **king**'s trusty manservants, since she is but a tired old hag-monster. But a super pissed **one**.Beowulf is all like \"Nuh-uh!\", and takes off to the swamp. He dives through the murky waters and busts into mama's dank home, kicks her ass and steals the head of Grendel to prove that he's way tougher than those monsters. The **king** tell's Beowulf he is like a son to him and gives him more gold.So Beowulf and his **men** go **back** to their home, and Beowulf gets all this land, and eventually becomes **king**. Everything is, of course, awesome with Beowulf as **king**. That is, until some transient sneaks into the dragon cave and steals a piece of treasure that the dragon is protecting, and awakens the fury of the ill-tempered fire-breather! They have to keep rebuilding things because that damn dragon keeps burning everything down.Beowulf will have none of this. At this point he is an old **man**, but he's still the toughest thing around, still as cocky as ever. He gets some more **men** together, they go to the dragon cave, Beowulf wants all the glory so he heads into the cave himself. Beowulf has had a premonition of his death before going into the dragon cave, and the dragon is messing him up pretty good. All but **one** of his **men** turn out to be big wusses and run away when the dragon starts breathing fire at them. One guy sticks it out with B. and lands a solid blow on the dragon. But that guy doesn't kill the dragon. He just preps the dragon for death, then Beowulf, of course, lands the lethal blow.The dragon is dead! But Beowulf is almost dead too, though he's not going to die until he sees the invaluable treasures that the dragon has been guarding. That other guy brings some gold out to Beowulf to see, and B. tells him exactly how the monument to his death should be built, and how **many** of his treasures should be incinerated with him in the funeral pyre.This seems like an honorable and decent **end** for the hero, saving the people once again. But people start getting worried. None of them are as tough as Beowulf, so without him around, they are sure to be invaded by their enemies that Beowulf has kept away all those years. um... I don't remember what happens next. maybe i need to reread the last ten pages."

There is much debate on which order the books should be read in, but I’m happy with the order I’m taking it. Shasta is running away from his home after he overhears a plot to sell him into slavery. On his way, he meets a talking Narnian horse named Bree who is trying to find his way **back** to Narnia. They start on an **adventure** together and meet **many** friends along the way, including the Highnesses of Narnia. A **battle** breaks out and secrets are revealed. This next chapter in The Chronicles of Narnia is full of **adventure** and heart. My favorite part is when Aslan makes his appearance and his presence known. “‘Who are you?’ asked Shasta. ‘Myself,’ said the voice, very deep and low so that the earth shook: and again, ‘Myself,’ loud and clear and gay: and then a third **time** ‘Myself’ , whispered so softly you could hardly hear it, and yet it seemed to come from all around you as if the leaves restyled with it.”"

       "This is hands down the best book in this trilogy and it gives me chills and so **many** feels whenever I read it. Just everything about this Gollum has already brought Frodo and Sam as far as to Minas Morgul where the Sauron's armies are about to be released and sent towards Minas Tirith to attack the **world** of **men**. The group splits up and Sam is set to return **back** to the Shire while Gollum and Frodo continue to Cirith Ungol.Frodo and Gollum eventually **end** up in Shellob's lair because Gollum had came up with the corrupted scheme to let Frodo get eaten by the gigantic Ungoliant spider. Fortunately Frodo can always count on Sam's loyalty because Sam would follow him to the **world**'s **end**. Sam fights with Shelob. Sadly after this **battle** Frodo gets taken away by orcs and Sam ends up having to chase him to Cirith Ungol where he saves Frodo once more. Honestly Frodo wouldn't be anything without Sam and we all know it. Gandalf and Pippin leave for Minas Tirith which is the capital of Gondor. During their stay there they become aware that Sauron's army is on its way to fight against the **men** of Gondor who are weak and unprepared. And thus the Battle of Pelennor Fields begins.While the **battle** had already begun Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas search the Paths of the Dead beyond the forest of Dimholt to find the cursed people. Aragorn asks them to fight with them so that he will lift their curse. At **first** the ghosts decline his bold offer, but eventually they fight alongside them on the battlefield. The very best part about this whole **battle** is certainly the Rohirrim Charge which will cause your adrenaline to pump and makes you want to climb onto a horse to be a part of the **battle**. What makes this **battle** even better is the fact that there was a large quantity of Oliphaunts who were being led their by the Haradim. Eowyn had covered her face before she had joined the **battle** so that no **one** would recognize her. She ends up in front of the Witchking of Angmar who taunts her and says that 'No **man** can kill him'. Being the absolute badass that she is she completely surprised him, \"But no living **man** am I! You are looking upon a woman. Eowyn am I, Eomund's daughter. You stand between me and my lord and kin. Begone, if you be not deathless! For living or dark undead, I will smite you, if you touch him.\" She ends up decapitating him in a way to protect her uncle. When the Battle of Pelennor Fields has come to an **end** and was won, Sam and Frodo got closer towards Mount Doom without Sauron seeing them. While the weight of the One Ring becomes too heavy for Frodo to carry, Sam insist to carry Frodo instead being the wonderful friend that he is. As the remainder of the Fellowship is fighting Sauron's army at the Black Gates of Mordor, Sam and Frodo were being attacked by Gollum who had chased them. The three of fight for while **end** Gollum ends up falling into the lava with the One Ring and destroys it. It's such a beautiful moment when after the destruction of the One Ring that Gandalf comes to rescue Frodo and Sam along with a flock of the Great Eagles because at that very moment you realize that **two** Halflings have truly succeeded in fulfilling this mission and have restored balance to Middle-Earth. Never underestimate hobbits!The coronation of Aragorn is an iconic **one** because with that an new era begins and the Fellowship of the Ring has officially come to an **end**. Still the **story** ends when all the hobbits take Bilbo with them to the Grey Havens where he will accompany Gandalf, Frodo and some of the elves as they sail to the Undying Lands. I always bawl my eyes out because that is the last moment that I will ever read about Bilbo Baggins who will always be my favorite fictional character that was ever written. It break my heart. Thankfully he wasn't alone which does reassure me somewhat. I think it's safe to say that no fantasy series will ever come as close to the genius of Tolkien's work and we all know this.- The Fellowship of the Ring ★★★★★- The Two Towers ★★★★★- The Return of the King ★★★★★- The Hobbit ★★★★★- The Silmarillion ★★★★★- Beren and Luthien ★★★★"

In the **story**, Jim, a doctor, the captain, Long John ,and the mutineers sail on a ship called the Hispaniola and arrive to Treasure Island. While sailing in the ship, Jim finds out that Long John and some of the crew are mutineers,(He found out while he was in an apple barrel.) so when the Hispaniola settles on Treasure Island, the mutiny starts. I liked this book because mostly I like pirates, but I **also** liked the **adventure** packed in the book. There were a lot of words I didn't recognize so if you are reading this book, then make sure you have a good vocabulary. The book made it feel like that I was right there, experiencing that **adventure**. Some of the words aren't spelled correctly, you can tell that the ones with the apostrophes are spelled wrong. Robert Louis Stevenson made the right choice to write this book, and if he was here right now, then I would say thank you for writing this book. "

       "This is my review of the entire The Lord of the Rings trilogy. It scarcely seems necessary to do a review of this work, it is so well known, and recently turned into a movie series to boot. It is the Platonic ideal of the epic high fantasy genre, and at the heart of Tolkien's work through his life. The **first** effort in this fantasy **world** was the children's book The Hobbit, but as it was successful Tolkien's publisher wanted more, and Tolkien obliged. Originally it was intended that the The Lord of the Rings would be the **first** volume, with the Silmarillion as volume 2, but the publisher decided to break it into three volumes (though each of those three has **two** parts, so **one** could as well call it a six-volume work). The overall summary is that the dark lord Sauron created Rings of Power: Three for Elves, 7 for Dwarves, and 9 for Men. Then he created the One ring to rule the others and to corrupt them. He loses this ring in a **battle** and is trying to get it **back**, and if he does his power will corrupt all of Middle Earth. The only way to stop him is to destroy the ring, and that can only be done in the fires of Mount Doom where it was originally forged. So a mixed group of Hobbits, Elves, Dwarves, and Men, plus the wizard Gandalf, set out to do just that. The work is about all of the adventures they have along the way.The themes embedded in this work display the discomfort Tolkien had with the modern **world**, and much of that derives from his experience of World War I. Because of the subsequent World War II and the Cold War, the **first** World War has faded in the minds of **many** people. But it was a particularly searing experience to those who lived through it. For example, if you look at the total number of Americans killed in Vietnam over the entire course of the **war**, that is less than half of the number killed on both sides in just 6-day Battle of the Marne in 1914. Human life was of no account in this **war**, and the butchery was staggering. It was the modern industrial **war**, and even the killing was industrialized.. Tolkien displays in The Lord of the Rings a deep disdain for industrialization. And as is the case with so much fantasy, class structure is implicitly important, and some races are irredeemably evil. But it has won **many** awards, and in 2003 the BBC named it Britain's best novel of all **time**. Virtually all high fantasy traces its roots to Tolkien. "

       "a **great** work of science fiction, and Jules Verne is able to be able to ground his book and make it seem like a true expedition, instead of it just seeming like a **story**. The author gives **great** detail to biological life in this book too, which being able to name and specify **many** types of plants, rocks, and creatures, in turn making the book very enjoyable and almost education to read. The book follows Axel, the nephew if a brilliant mineralogist, Otto LidenBrock, whom find a manuscript and decipher it, finding out that there is a cave opening to the center of the earth in Iceland. Once they get there, they hire a tall strong guide by the name of Hans. Together the trio find the cave opening and venture into the cave. They later find out that the went into a dead **end** tunnel, and reverse to go through another **one**. They later run dry on water, and Axel loses hope, but Hans leaves them and ends up finding a river, and they find each other through the echo's of the cave. They then get to the center of the earth, and see giant mushrooms and strange plants, and even a few dead human bodies. They keep on venturing until they think that they need to cross a large underground sea to get to the other side. They do this but **end** up spectating a fight between **two** ancient dinosaurs in the water are a carried **back**, in ruins, to the shore were they began. They lose hope but then find markings from the writer of the manuscript, and see other large dinosaurs, and I am pretty sure a 20 or 12 foot **man**, but they decide to not disturb him. They then see that there will be a volcanic eruption and are carried to the surface by said explosion and find themselves in some type of jungle. Axels uncle becomes famous for the books he writes and lives happily ever after. It is a very enjoyable and interesting book to read, and science fiction, and **adventure** book readers will enjoy it."

       "A decade ago I read Jon Krakauer's exciting travel **adventure** book Into Thin Air about a disastrous attempt to scale Mt. Everest. The book read like a fictional **adventure** tale though it was reporting actual events. Jules Verne's classic travel **adventure** tale reads like a non-fiction account of an actual expedition even though it was the fictional product of Verne's imagination. Journey to the Centre of the Earth was Jules Verne's second book, the **first** was Five Weeks in a Balloon (and another was being published serially in a magazine). When Prof. Lidenbrock deciphers an old parchment that describes a secret passage through a volcano to the centre of the earth, nothing will stop him and his nephew Axel from embarking on a perilous, terrifying **journey** through the subterranean **world**. Thus begins the **adventure** that will take them to Iceland and downward through a volcano into the center of the earth itself. Verne uses young Axel as the protagonist and in so doing creates a version of the classic heroic **journey**. Alex will eventually be separated from the other travelers and face challenges on his own before rejoining them for the conclusion of the **journey**. Each of Verne's novels are marvels of action, **adventure**, ideas, science and sometimes the fantastic. In this case the emphasis is primarily on the scientific, but if you suspend your disbelief and join Verne on his more fantastic journeys like From the Earth to the Moon you find enjoyable tales. This novel is not my favorite by Verne -- see Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea for that, but it is as they say, a rollicking good **story**."

       "\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\" by Jules Verne is an exciting tale about a Professor, his nephew, and a guide that attempt a trip to the earth's core. First guided by an ancient paper about a similar **journey**, the group partakes on their mission by descending through a crater. They come across several mishaps, including a member of the party getting lost, an underground storm, and shortages of food, water and crucial supplies. The **story** keeps you on the edge of your seat, always wondering whether or not the party will make it to the center of the earth, or even survive. I gave this book a 5-star rating and would reccomend to people who are fans of classic literature, and like an interesting suspense-filled novel."

       "John Ronald Reuel (J. R. R.) Tokien (1892-1973) wrote The Hobbit or \n",
       "There and Back Again\n",
       " after serving in World War I (1914-1918). This book's themes of personal growth and forms of heroism were based on his own and other writers' experiences. Particularly those writers who **also** served in that **war**. This book was a huge success both critically and financially so Tolkien's publisher requested him to write a sequel. That sequel was the trilogy Lord of the Rings that was mostly written at the **time** World War II (1939-1945) was happening. Bilbo Baggins, a 50-y/o hobbit is asked by the wizard Gandalf to accompany 13 dwarves (Thorin, Dwalin, Balin, Kili, Fili, Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur and Bomfur) to get **back** the treasures that used to be theirs. The treasures are in the Lonely Mountain being guarded by a dragon, Smaug and other creatures like **man**-eating trolls, goblins, evil wolves or Wargs and giant spiders. Being a hobbit, Bilbo prefers to stay at home. In fact, during the **journey** to the mountain he oftentimes dreams of being in his house, cooking or eating and relaxing on his armchair. Being a reluctant hero adds to his charm. At **first** he is a helpless baggage to the more combative Thorin and I laughed out loud in **one** of the escape scenes when Bilbo was holding on the leg of Balin while the later was rolling from a mountain trying avoid the **man**-eating trolls. Referring to his hurting arms, Bilbo says \"my arms, my arms\" to which Balin replies \"my leg, my leg\".Being a children's book, it is pure superb entertainment. From dwarves, wizard, hobbit that go up to the mountain, they meet all the other evil and non-evil creatures and other characters (some of them would **also** be in LOTR) like elves, the sage Elrond, bearman Beorn, Bard the bowman and my favorite Gollum a.k.a. \"my pressscious\", a strange creature inhabiting an underground lake. The the **story**'s climax is the Battle of Five Armies, where dwarves, **men** and elves band together and fight the combined forces of Wargs and goblins.But like any well-known children's books, it has a deeper meaning. That deeper meaning is due to the fact that Tolkien drew the inspiration about that **battle** from his WWI personal experiences. Then this typical children's book becomes a whole different reading experience altogether.  Trivia: Just this morning, I read in Philippine Star that a **two**-part movie adaptation of this book is in the making. Cate Blanchett, who will reprise her role as Galadriel or ElvenQueen. I did not find that character here in this book. I only remember reading ElvenKing. Anyway, part I of The Hobbit: The Movie will be shown in December 2012. Grrr....Two years from now!"

       "A riveting **adventure** summed up as a series of unfortunate events multiplied tenfold and blew it into epic proportions!I have to admit that this is the **first** **time** I've read Homer's Odyssey; and I liked it. My heart goes to poor Odysseus, who after surviving the ten-year Trojan **war**, has to circumnavigate the odds and begin a ten-year voyage **back** home to his grieving family in Ithaca. His voyage home was never easy. Teemed with trials and tribulations, he traveled to the underworld, encountered hideous creatures, and incurred the wrath of the gods themselves: from the savage Polyphemus, six-headed monster, Scylla, notorious Charybdis, sorceress Circe, the enchanting Calypso, to the vengeful Helios and Poseidon — how disastrous can you get towards a **man** who just wants some nice peace and quiet at home?However, the notion of peace and quiet is elusive to Odysseus' home as overindulgent **men** (The Suitors) flocked and wooed Penelope and even thought of slaughtering Odysseus' son, Telemachus. They feasted merrily and consumed their host's rations and believed that our ephemeral hero has passed away. Or so they thought...Disguised as a vagrant and blessed by the goddess Athena, Odysseus appeared before them and surprised the nitwit and cocky buggers! And all I know is that violence ensued — the kind of bloody, brutal, sadistic, lethal, and explosive violence you've seen in the movie 300, minus the sexiness and homoerotic subtexts. Yes, folks, that kind of violence:\n",
       "So he spoke, and taking the cable of a dark-prowed ship, fastened it to the tall pillar, and fetched it about the round-house;and like thrushes, who spread their wings, or pigeons, who haveflown into a snare set up for them in a thicket, tryingto find a resting place, but the sleep given them was hateful;so their heads were all in a line, and each had her neck caughtfast in a noose, so that their death would be most pitiful.They struggled with their feet for a little, not for very **long**.They took Melanthios along the porch and the courtyard.They cut off, with the pitiless bronze, his nose and his ears,tore off his private parts and gave them to the dogs to feed onraw, and lopped off his hands and feet, in fury of anger.\n",
       "Aside from telling the tale of Odysseus' **journey**, Homer's The Odyssey, on a deeper level, tackles the human experience — all its glory, failures, defeat, and victory in our lives, overcoming these struggles with resoluteness and resilience whilst imparting wisdom, and weaving everything with the force of the indomitable human spirit."

Rarely have I so enjoyed a **story** with the main character as an old **man** of no discernible features, no dialogues other than the ones he has with himself. Patience, grit, belief. Loyalty to the sea and the deference paid to the fish. His fight against the sharks — at once fighting /for/ the marlin and alongside /with/ it. The arm wrestle **story**. The rope burns on his hands. How the boy cried after seeing him home. The beautiful pearlescent carcass of the fish, its bones dignified even after death. The anticlimatic denouement after that awesome struggle at sea. Soon he will sail again. Brava!"

This third book build on the **journey** traveled in the **first** **two** books, but everything converges into the final **battle**, the final confrontation between good and evil, and to see if Frodo and Sam will make it to Mount Doom to \"unmake\" the ring that binds them all. I found this book to be extremely exciting as the side of good struggles to hang on, **battle** after **battle**, while the hobbit's, Frodo and Sam inch closer to their destination. I was excited, but **also** depressed as I neared the **end** of this book, and realized that the grand **adventure** would soon be over. I have always loved these epic journeys, and this book did not disappoint. Those of you who have seen the movies before reading any of these books...beware! In the books, there is much more singing from the Hobbit's, and history being constantly tied into the present, which is why if you love the history part, you should read the book which comes before all J.R.R Tolkien Hobbit books, \"Silmarillion\", which lays out all of the history of the **world**, and gives you a deeper understanding of who the characters are, and why they behave as they do."

What a climax! It takes Tolkien a **long** **time** to wrap things up (the Ring is destroyed halfway through the book), but there were so **many** loose ends that had to be tied up, to me it's understandable. One of the most touching scenes I've ever read was when Frodo leaves Sam, Merry, and Pipin to sail across the sea to Valinor with Gandalf, Galadriel, and Elrond. So sad! So touching! The relationship between Sam & Frodo was **also** very touching. Sam was so devoted to his friend Frodo! What bravery! What devotion!

Fifty years later, Beowulf goes on a reunion tour with his best warrior Wiglaf and takes down a big damn dragon.Beowulf really appeals to me as a work of myth and legend: good versus evil, a mighty hero against three monsters, **adventure**, and treasure. It was much more readable than I expected and the only parts that tripped me up were some of the allusions to other characters and events that were historically relevant but didn't seem to be quite integral to the **story**. Recorded **long** after the events are supposed to have happened by a Christian poet, **many** of the qualities of the pagan legend conflict with the author's values and it was really interesting to see attempts to justify the culture that Beowulf succeeds in."

Many passages are eminently ripe for parody: “Oh, darling, I don’t want you to go.” “Then I won’t go, darling.” “Oh, but darling, I want you to go. You must go. I was just being silly. That’s over now.” “Are you sure, darling? Because I could stay.” “No, darling, do go.” And so forth. He really seems almost unable to express emotion without delving into sappy sentimentality. At other times, however, Hemingway cuts to the bone with his perspicacity, as in the tense “But if she should die” inner dialogue, or the very famous passage on how life’ll kill ya: \"If people bring so much courage to this **world** the **world** has to kill them to break them, so of course it kills them. The **world** breaks every **one** and afterward **many** are strong at the broken places. But those that will not break it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially. If you are none of these you can be sure it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry.\" Certainly, it’s a fine book and a **great** **war** novel.

Beowulf then rips the monsters arms off and he bleeds out in his cave. Grendel’s mother comes in kills some people, then Beowulf goes to her home under the lake and kills her too.\tThe central idea of the book is basically that Beowulf is cool and he kills a lot of monsters. Not much too it. A piece of dialogue that drove Beowulf as a character was when he said that Grendel doesn’t fight with weapons, so he will fight him with his hands to make it a fair fight.\tI really liked this book but it is so confusing. It was written 1300 years ago in a different language so that is not very surprising. I would not recommend this to the average reader because it gets so slow and boring at some times."

To be truthful the storyline was often boring and slow moving, but when the book started to get interesting again I really enjoyed it.A talking horse named, Bree and his boy, Shasta are both slaves to terrible people and when they have the chance to run away they take it. To Narnia and North they head. Along the way the come into contact with another talking horse named Hwin and a young girl, **also** a princess, named Aravis. They all make this dangerous **journey** together. You see, this was a very dangerous **journey** because they were being chased by a very evil **man** by the name of Rabadash. He was trying to take over Narnia and kill the kings and queens that rule. Along the way he discovers who the children and horses are and will stop at nothing to see that any **one** who stands in his way is killed. Along the way Bree, Hwin, Shasta, and Aravis must cross through the woods, desert, strange cities, they are even separated from each other, and even come inches away from being caught by Rabadash. Nothing will stop them from getting to Narmia and their freedom, even the **great** lion Aslan will prevent their **journey**."

       "Gullivers Travels is the quintessential social commentary wrapped in the cloak of an **adventure** tale. The beginning details Gullivers earlier travels and the love he develops for travelling the high seas. After marriage and a small family, Gullivers developing wanderlust eventually drives him out to seek further adventures. In his **first** **adventure**, Gulliver's ship wrecks in a storm and he washes up on the shore of a country called Lilliput, where the inhabitants, despite their 6 inch stature, still manage to hold him hostage. Gulliver becomes a favorite of the King, for a **time**, assisting his **war** efforts against their neighboring enemy country, Blefuscu. Eventually, though, the King and his counselors become suspicious of Gulliver, and when he refuses to help the King expand his territory by enslaving the Blefuschians, the King orders Gulliver blinded. Gulliver escapes to his next **adventure** where he lands in a country of giants called Brobdingnag. Discovered and cared for by a local farmer, Gulliver, after a **time**, becomes a popular pet of the nobility. His attempts to explain the rest of the **world** to the King falls on deaf ears, particularly his description of **war** machines like guns and cannons. One day, an eagle picks up Gullivers little box/house and dumps him **back** to sea where he is rescued by his normal-sized bretheren. On their way **back** to England, another misfortunate strikes and Gulliver is marooned on an **island** in the middle of nowhere. Fortunately, he's rescued by a floating country **island** called Laputa, where music, art and intellectual achievement are prized above all else. Gulliver observes, though, that Laputa's intellectual pursuits are completely ridiculous and unpracticable for everyday use. So much so, that the waste of monetary resources on these pursuits have caused ruin throughout the country. Though he tries to convince the Grand Academy of Ladago of this, it is evident his opinions are unwanted. Gulliver is left at the **island** of Balnibarbi to await a ship that will take him to Japan. He makes another sidetrip to Glubbdubdrib and Luggnagg, where he meets a race of immortals who are left forever old and are considered dead at 80 years old. After that, Gulliver makes it **back** home to England to spend **time** with his family.After working as a surgeon for a while, the flighty tempress of travel, once again, overwhelms his heart and Gulliver sets out for another **adventure**. This **time** he his mutinied and left upon an **island**, as his ship and crew leave to become pirates. On the unknown **island**, Gulliver **first** encounters savages that look vaguely like humans. Then he meets a talking horse who calls himself a Houyhnhm. After **many** months, Gulliver is able to understand the savages are called Yahoos and are slaves to the peaceful and intelligent race of Houyhnhms, who at **first** sought to civilize the Yahoo's but eventually gave up and now use them for labor. Gulliver is able to spend **many** peaceful and thoughtful years living with his Houyhnhm master, who recognizes that he is not a Yahoo. As Gulliver comes to love, respect and cherish the Houyhnhms society and culture, he becomes increasingly loathe to leave these perfect creatures. However, the Council of Houyhnhms, unfortunately, rule that Gulliver is unable to stay in their society because they perceive him as a Yahoo with some reason, and thus a danger to their society. Heartbroken, Gulliver is rescued by a Portuguese ship and brought **back** to England. At this point, Gulliver sees society though the eyes of the Houyhnhm and views his fellow countryman as Yahoos. In the **end**, he becomes a recluse and eccentric, spending his days talking with the horses in his stable.A masterful piece of literature that dramatically highlights our human vices, follies and shortcomings. A recommended read for everyone, as both those seeking **adventure** and/or thoughtful musings will be satisfied by the epic magnitude of the tale."

Bilbo vanished from his own party with the help of the Ring, as he wanted to go for a **long** holiday without informing anyone. He left the Ring for Frodo among other things, on Gandalf's suggestion. The Ring belonged to the Dark Lord which upon his capture came into Gollum's hands, he called it his Precious. It was a wretched Ring of Power and always looked after itself. Sauron the Dark Lord had risen and returned to the Dark Tower of Mordor. Frodo, the ring bearer, after Bilbo Baggins was given the task to take the Ring to Mordor in order to destroy it forever. He along with Sam, Merry and Pippins started their **journey**. While they were on it, Nazguls as Black Riders (Sauron's most powerful servants) were trailing them for the Dark Lord. They went through the forest where they met Tom Bombadill who saved Merry and Pippins from the Old Man Willow. After staying with Tom Bombadill for a few days they began the **journey** again and met with Striker (Aragorn) who was to accompany them while Gandalf was away on some other mission. Frodo was attacked by the Black Riders but luckily survived and was taken to Rivendell where he met with Gandalf and Bilbo. Bilbo had been staying at Rivendell since he disappeared. The council (**one** of the reasons why I gave this book less rating) which stretched for **many** chapters, unnecessarily, took place and in that it was decided that the Ring Bearer would be accompanied by his friends, Gandalf, Aragorn, Gimli the Dwarf, Boromir and Legolas the Elf to finish off the task. At the bridge of Khazad-Dum, Gandalf the Grey goes down the hollow while fighting the Balrog. Gollum had been following the Company while lurking around in shadows for his Precious, the Ring. Boromir was always weary of Frodo and wanted to snatch the Ring from him which scared Frodo so he planned to finish the task himself, without bothering anyone but Sam followed him on and they went together leaving the Company behind.

       "Tolkien completes this classic trilogy, tying off all the loose ends left in Middle-Earth. When Tolkien left off, the reader was neck-deep in information about the Shadow of Mordor's spread across the land. With the Companions of the Ring involved in separate adventures, the forces of evil can, and do, strike on all sides. The armies of the Dark Lord are massing as his evil shadow spreads ever wider. Men, Dwarves, Elves and Ents unite to **battle** agains the Dark, which has a plethora of soldiers of their own. Aragorn, revealed as the hidden heir of the ancient Kings of the West, has joined the **battle** to defeat the forces of Isengard, all in order to take **back** his throne. Sam has left his master, Frodo, for dead after being captured by the giant spider, Shelob. However, Frodo lives, but is now in the hands of the Orcs. And the Dark Lord's forces are massing as the One Ring draws ever nearer to the Cracks of Doom. Can the forces of good defat the powers of evil and destroy the One Ring before it is used for the ultimate evil? This epic trilogy comes to an **end**, still full of **adventure** and strong imagery, which only supports Tolkien's title as master of the fantasy genre.Having read the trilogy (plus The Hobbit) recently, it is my pleasure to take a moment to reflect on the epic collection. It truly is impossible to describe in a few words, but any dedicated (and this is no small mantle to place upon anyone's shoulders) reader will know that Tolkien's work of fiction has been labelled as **one** of the classic fantasy collections to date. At times comic, but **also** highly diabolic, the narrative is constructed in a way that shifts between characters and scenes through a highly imaginary **world**, which sustains its convincing detail. While I am no literary historian, I believe Tolkien cut the genre wide open and has been a foundational participant in influencing **many** over the past sixty years since the Lord of the Rings trilogy emerges. While highly entertaining, the writing is **also** very detailed and can lose the reader who is not well-versed in the fantasy genre. And yes, I admit that I am **one** of those people. Yet, the **story** which led to a very Revelations-like feel, pitting Good versus Evil has a number of images that have been used through the ages to depict this key **battle**, of which Tolkien is surely a key contributor throughout his four books on Middle-Earth.Kudos, Mr. Tolkien for this entertaining and masterful piece of work. I can finally say that I've made it through this collection. Bring on the movies!"

       "564.\tAnimal Farm, George OrwellAnimal Farm is an allegorical novella by George Orwell, **first** published in England on 17 August 1945. According to Orwell, the book reflects events leading up to the Russian Revolution of 1917 and then on into the Stalinist era of the Soviet Union. Orwell, a democratic socialist, was a critic of Joseph Stalin and hostile to Moscow-directed Stalinism, an attitude that was critically shaped by his experiences during the Spanish Civil War. The Soviet Union, he believed, had become a brutal dictatorship, built upon a cult of personality and enforced by a reign of terror. In a letter to Yvonne Davet, Orwell described Animal Farm as a satirical tale against Stalin (\"un conte satirique contre Staline\"), and in his essay \"Why I Write\" (1946), wrote that Animal Farm was the **first** book in which he tried, with full consciousness of what he was doing, \"to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into **one** whole\".Old Major, the old boar on the Manor Farm, summons the animals on the farm together for a meeting, during which he refers to humans as \"enemies\" and teaches the animals a revolutionary song called \"Beasts of England\". When Major dies, **two** young pigs, Snowball and Napoleon, assume command and consider it a duty to prepare for the Rebellion. The animals revolt and drive the drunken and irresponsible farmer Mr. Jones from the farm, renaming it \"Animal Farm\". They adopt the Seven Commandments of Animalism, the most important of which is, \"All animals are equal.\"Snowball teaches the animals to read and write, while Napoleon educates young puppies on the principles of Animalism. Food is plentiful, and the farm runs smoothly. The pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership and set aside special food items, ostensibly for their personal health.Some **time** later, several **men** attack Animal Farm. Jones and his **men** are making an attempt to recapture the farm, aided by several other farmers who are terrified of similar animal revolts. Snowball and the animals, who are hiding in ambush, defeat the **men** by launching a surprise attack as soon as they enter the farmyard. Snowball's popularity soars, and this event is proclaimed \"The Battle of the Cowshed\". It is celebrated annually with the firing of a gun, on the anniversary of the Revolution. Napoleon and Snowball vie for pre-eminence.

The **journey** is a tale of them re-discovering who they are and who they became in their previous days in Narnia.All in all, the **story** was a rousing read to encourage children and adults alike to always stand up for what is right and to join the cause of the good and noble. It is **also** a reminder of the power that each individual person has inside and that together we can all make a difference."

       "The Horse and His Boy is set during the golden age of Narnia. The evil witch has been defeated, the everlasting winter is over, and peace and freedom have returned to Narnia under the reign of the four Pevensie children as kings and queens of Narnia.Far south, in the country of Calormen, there lived a boy (Shasta) and his father (Arsheesh). Arsheesh is a poor fisherman, neither very happy nor very kind, who would beat Shasta every now and then. One day, a rich nobleman travels by and stays at the fisherman's hut for the night. Shasta overhears them and learns **two** things: 1) Arsheesh is not his real father, and 2) the Calormene nobleman wants to buy Shasta and keep him as a slave. The boy and the nobleman's horse Bree - not a normal, but a talking horse from Narnia! - decide to escape slavery and to flee to Narnia together. Soon, they meet Aravis and Hwin, who are running away to Narnia just like Shasta and Bree. Aravis is about the same age as Shasta, is a noblewoman, and is forced to get married to a high ranking Calormene nobleman - the last thing she is willing to do. Hwin is a talking horse from Narnia and, like Bree, wants to return home. The four friends are eager to get to the North, to Archenland and Narnia, but their **journey** is not an easy **one**.The Horse and His Boy is an awesome book, I enjoyed reading it a lot! For once, it's not about someone from our **world** entering Narnia. Both Shasta and Aravis have grown up in a country not too far from Narnia (as opposed to another **world**). However, Narnia is almost as foreign to them as it would be to us. The whole **story** is about doing the right or wrong thing, about friendship and wisdom, and of course, it's **one** big **adventure** again. Fun read!"

       "Wikipedia tells us that that Beowulf was composed between 8th to 11th centuries by an English poet who remains anonymous. Though this poem was considered to be **one** of the **first** and original works of English literature, is very much set in the Saxon lands of Northern Europe and tells a tale inhabited with the Swedes and Danes. The poem primarily deals with the battles and triumphs of Beowulf, a hero of the Geats (modern norther Sweden) and spans over 50 years from his youth till his death. The poem begins with the distress felt by Hrothgar, the old King of Danes, whose people are being devoured by the monster Grendel. Hrothgar was once a brave and valiant King and though he remains noble and kind, he is unable to take any action against Grendel. Beowulf, then a young warrior from Geatland , hears of the troubles of Hrothgar and with band of courageous comrades, sets out to kill Grendel. Beowulf and his team enter Grendel’s lair, but Beowulf alone fights the monster and kills him ripping his arm from his body. Enraged at her son’s death, Grendel’s mother ends the celebrations at Hrothagar’s Hall by carrying off **one** of Beowulf’s most trusted warrior, Aeschere. The Geats and Danes once again set off in pursuit of this monster and Beowulf finally kills Grendel’s mother in her cavern. Hereafter, Beowulf returns home and becomes a King to his people and 50 years pass of peace when life is once again disrupted for the hero when a slave steals a cup from the lair of the dragon, who sees the theft and is enraged and begins buring down all habitation. Beowulf again musters his warriors and sets off to kill the dragon. Soon Beowulf is locked in a deadly combat with the dragon and his **men** fearing their own lives, flee the **battle**, leaving Beowulf alone. Only **one** loyal retainer, Wiglaf, remains steadfast and helps Beowulf slay the dragon. However Beowulf is mortally wounded and soon dies. Wigalf predicts the defeat of the Geats in the hands of the Swedes, because of their betrayal of Beowulf and the dragon’s treasure is left where it was found.What can I possibly say about the poem that has not been said before? Since this is a translated work, I cannot really comment on the language, but it is the structure of the **story** and characters that takes your breath away! It is a grand **adventure**, it is **story** of a simpler **time**, but its values of courage and loyalty and nobility still sustain. It is an epic **adventure** and yet is **also** a **story** of mankind. Beowulf is the natural hero – brave, strong and loyal. He has all honorable intentions and acts with principle even when the greatest rewards are for his taking. For instance when Hrothgar makes him a brother to his own sons, after killing of Grendel, he could have easily taken over the Danes, but does not do so. Even in his native land of Geats, after King Hygelac’s death, though Beowulf is urged to take over the kingdom, he supports Headred the son of Hygelac and only becomes King at Headred's death. But this poem is not only about Beowulf, all other characters shine through. Hrothgar has no longer the ability to fight monsters, but his goodness still makes his revered and loved by the Danes. The contrasting characters cleverly point out that there is a difference between a good warrior and a good **king** and **one** may not always be the other – a very revolutionary concept in a **time** filled with wars and disturbances. Wigalf, the brave solider who could have taken the easy way out, but chooses instead to do stand by his King and do his part for no reason or reward, except that it’s expected of him. Even the monsters come to life and can be seen through the mind’s eye as they destruct and kill. The characters bring in all the fragility and tension that inhabit human nature, the concerns on divided loyalties and the choices **man** makes. I **also** loved the unique blend of pagan and Christian beliefs that comes through the poem. Christianity was its nascent stages in when the poem was being composed and the poet beautifully marries the nobler aspect of Christianity with the good solid belief system of the pagan **world** which has seen its people through **many** a terrible times.It is a wonderful read and I loved the grandeur and the simplicity of the **story** and will definitely go **back** for several re-reads!

Most of the book, I found that I couldn't follow the action and/or the dialogue, and it was all just extremely tedious. There were a few clever moments **like** when Odysseus had to outsmart the Cyclops, but the dialogue and the \"begats\" (i.e., Telamachus, son of Odysseus, who is Laertes' son) just got in the way of the narrative. The plot felt very disjointed. After **reading** this, I'm leary about **reading** other ancient epics **like** Arabian Nights, which I have on my TBR. The only other book **like** this that I've **read** is the Epic of Gilgamesh in college, which I actually remember enjoying. I wish I could come up with more positive, but I just **didn**'t **enjoy** The Odyssey. I so wanted to **like** this because it is a classic, but **maybe** it's just not my thing. "

I do not judge anyone for loving it. You can love the book Lolita. You can shout its praises from all over. You can make the hills alive with the sound of Lolita praise. But not I. If everyone has a classic they dislike (or two or five) then this is mine.Yes, the **writing** is unique but I still do not **like** the book.And now I must admit I gave it three **stars** in deference of its classic status.To all involved in a certain recent Lolita conversation, this is for you.

The way the author saw young girls bothered me. Sure I have **read** books on murder, rape, etc... But when you write about children the way this author does it makes me sick. Overall, I decided not to rate this book because I couldn't stomach **reading** enough to **give** a **rating**. That said, as a mother I'm saddened by the 5 **star** ratings. I don't see this book as a classic, I see it as trash that should have been thrown away along **time** ago. Just my thoughts"

So I say, watch the **movie**, **read** the play, and enjoy yourself immensely! :)"

       "I'm starting to hate \"the mainstream's\" fascination with dystopian **novels**. It's basically an education system marketing ploy dreamed up by the Media Lords in control of Orwell and Huxley's copyrights. Also academics and lay readers are ashamed to discuss science **fiction** these days so they have to fancy it up with genres like the dystopian **novel**. Brave New World is a pretty good dystopian yarn, fairly outdated (though not as outdated as 1984), fairly well **written**, fairly well executed. I hope it's not Huxley's **best** **work** (he is, I think, a little overrated himself) but it certainly can't be his worst. But I really believe dystopian **novels** are the lazy \"mainstream\" writer and reader's idea of slumming into \"speculative\" **fiction** (fancy name for science **fiction**). It's science **fiction**'s own fault, really, as somewhere along the way it became primarily associated with BEMS and Jocks In Space and franchises like Star Trek (and nerds, don't forget the nerds). But there are some **great** science **fiction** writers that write more eloquently and acutely on \"future-present\" problems than this most famous of dystopian **novels**. Read something else for Christ's sake! Science **fiction** didn't end with the publication of Brave New World!"

In late 1959 the entire Herbert Clutter family of rural Kansas -- Mr. and Mrs. Clutter and their two youngest children Nancy and Kenyon -- were slaughtered for no particular reason except that the two drifters who sought them out had received bad advice about the alleged riches Mr. Clutter kept in his (nonexistent) office safe. In Capote's virtuoso hands, what might have been merely a downcast saga of \"outs\" tangling with \"ins\" becomes an amazingly gripping **story**. IN COLD BLOOD took years to research, write and edit, paving the way for other high quality, true-crime volumes like John Berendt's Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil or Dave Cullen's Columbine. In my opinion only purists quibble over whether this book should be classed as non-**fiction** or **fiction**; it IS non-**fiction** with dabs of narrative fill, but because some of Capote's techniques were new at the **time**, IN COLD BLOOD ever since then has straddled \"**best**-of\" lists to its overall detriment. Ignore that chatter and **read** this masterpiece for what it is.Note: Capote's research assistant out in rural Kansas was none other than (Nelle) Harper Lee, who wrote TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. The **story** of how Truman Capote came across the crime-and-punishment saga that became In Cold Blood, how it made him and later became his undoing, is told in two close-together movies: CAPOTE (2005) and INFAMOUS (2006). Good movies, but nothing can replace the experience of reading this seminal book."

       "As a disclaimer this is hardly a typical review but more a reflection on when I **read** this years ago. And also, a reflection upon mystery **novels** and genre authors.I seem to have made it my unofficial goal to have **one** **great** female author in every genre that I **read** (and vice versa). For Tolkien I have Susanna Clarke or Catherynne M. Valente; for Asimov and Bradbury in sci-fi I seem to have Anne McCaffrey (but other female sci-fi authors are waiting to be discovered). I still need to add a male author to the **classic** romance authors I love such as Austen, Elliot and the Brontes but perhaps Hardy may suffice. I also need to find a female author in the genres of gothic horror **fiction**, westerns and historical **fiction** (in general I need to **read** more historical **fiction**). It is not as if I set out to find male authors to contrast female authors or female authors to contrast the men, but rather I set out to find powerful **novels** regardless of who wrote them. The point of this all is that when I **first** **read** Murder on the Orient Express it was my **first** real taste of murder mystery **fiction**. A taste which led me towards the brilliance of Sherlock Holmes and other such **classic** mystery. In my young eyes Murder on the Orient Express was brilliantly plotted, full of twists and turns. Though Agatha Christie may be the world's biggest selling novelist of all **time** her **work** is hardly designed to be contriving, rather she seemed to set out to write a strong **novel**, an aim that paid off. Since reading this Agatha Christie **novel** I have discovered some of her other **works**. All generally strong, yet some stronger than others. It is clear to me that for her entire **work** Christie is a marvel of the mystery genre and should be **read** by all mystery fans. And my encouragement would be that, as Christie appears to have set out to write the **best** **novels** she could that we as readers look to **read** the **best** **fiction** we can find. I'd hate to find that my reading was becoming contrived on the basis of reading too **many** of **one** particular genre or author..."

آمریکایی، که با گزارشهای روزانه چارلی گوردون روایت میشود. چارلی بهره هوشی پائینی دارد، و دچار فراموشی ست، او توسط دو روانپزشک، تحت عمل جراحی ارتقاء هوش قرار میگیرد، و به بهره هوشی بسیار بالایی دست مییابد. کتاب به بیش از پنجاه زبان رایج دنیا ترجمه شده، و به صورت نمایشنامه، فیلم سینمایی و سریال، بارها به نمایش درآمده است. بخش نخست از ترجمه ی جناب آقای بازیاری از این کتاب به سالهای جوانی نویسنده اشاره دارد. دورانی که با فشار والدین، و بر خلاف علاقه ی خود، در رشته پزشکی درس میخوانده، دورانی که همزمان، نویسنده نیز بوده است. همین دوران موجب خلق داستانی شده، که بیشتر صحنه های آنرا از زندگی واقعی، و مشاهدات خود اقتباس کرده، و ماهرانه، و طبیعی کنار هم چیده، و کتابی عرضه داشته، که بیگمان، یکی از داستانهای همه جانبه، و فراموش نشدنی، برای هر خوانشگری خواهد بوداز متن همین کتاب: گذارش پیشرفط 1 – 5 مارس 1965دکتر «استراوس» می‌گه از امروز به بعد، من باید هر‌ چی فکر می‌کنم و هر‌ چی برام اطفاق می‌افته رو بنویسم. من نمی‌دونم چرا ولی اون می‌گه که این برای اینکه اون‌ها بفهمند که می‌تونند من رو استفاده کنند یا نه مهمه. من امیدوارم که اون‌ها من رو استفاده کنند. خانم «کینیان» می‌گه که شاید اون‌ها بتونند من رو باهوش کنند. من دوست دارم باهوش بشم. اسم من «چارلی گوردنه». سی و هفت سالمه، و دو هفته ‌ی پیش تولدم بود. من الان هیچ چیز دیگه ‌ای ندارم که بنویسم پس همین‌جا نوشتنم رو تموم می‌کنم گذارش پیشرفط 2 – 6 مارسمن امروز یه تست داشتم. فکر می‌کنم توش افتادم. و برای همین هم فکر کنم اون‌ها دیگه من رو استفاده نکنند. چیزی که اطفاق افتاد این بود که یه مرد جوون دوست ‌داشتنی توی اتاق بود و یه سری کارت‌های سفید که لکه‌ های جوهر روش ریخته بود داشت. اون گفت چارلی روی این کارت چی می‌بینی. من با‌ وجود این که پای خرگوشم توی جیبم بود خیلی ترسیده بودم چون وقتی بچه بودم همیشه توی تست‌های مدرسه می‌افتادم و جوهر روی کتاب‌هام پخش می‌کردممن گفتم که لکه ‌ی جوهر دیدم. اون گفت بله و این باعس شد اهساس خوبی بکنم. فکر کردم که همش همین بوده ولی همین‌که پا شدم بیام بیرون اون جلوم رو گرفت. اون گفت بشین چارلی کار ما هنوز تموم نشده. بعدش رو من خیلی خوب یادم نمی‌آد ولی اون از من می‌خاست بگم توی جوهرها چی هست. من هیچی توی جوهرها نمی‌دیدم ولی اون گفت که توی اون‌ها تسویر هستش و آدم‌های دیگه یه سری تسویر دیدند. من نتونستم هیچ تسویری ببینم. من خیلی تلاش کردم که ببینم. من کارت رو جلوی چشمم گرفتم بعد اَقب گرفتم. بعدش گفتم اگه اِینکم رو داشتم بهتر می‌تونستم ببینم. من معمولن اِینکم رو توی سینما یا برای دیدن تلویزون می‌زنم، با این هال گفتم که اِینکم توی کمد توی هاله. اِینکم رو زدم و بعد گفتم بزار اون کارت رو دوباره ببینم، شرت می‌بندم این دفعه پیداش می‌کنم.؛من خیلی تلاش کردم ولی بازهم نتونستم اَکس‌ها رو پیدا کنم فقط لکه‌های جوهر رو دیدم. من بهش گفتم شاید اِینک جدید نیاز دارم. اون یه چیزی روی کاقز نوشت و من ترسیدم که دوباره یه تست رو افتاده باشم. بهش گفتم که اون یه لکه ‌ی جوهر خیلی خوشگل بود با یه ‌سری نقته ‌ی ریز دور و برش. ولی اون به نزر ناراهت می‌رسید پس باید جوابم غلت بوده باشه. بهش گفتم بزار دوباره امتهان کنم. من خیلی زود پیداش می‌کنم چون بعزی وقت‌ها خیلی سریع نیستم. من توی کلاس خانم کینیان برای بزرگسالان کندزهن هم، یه کند‌خان هستم ولی من خیلی تلاش می‌کنم.؛اون با یه کارت دیگه که دوتا لکه ‌ی جوهر، یکی قرمز و یکی آبی، روش بود، یه شانس دیگه بهم داد.؛اون خیلی مرد خوبی بود و مسل خانم کینیان آروم حرف می‌زد و به من توزیح داد که این یه تجسم اهساسیه. اون گفت آدم‌ها توی جوهرها چیز می‌بینند. من گفتم نشونم بده کجا. گفت تسور کن. گفتم من یه لکه‌ ی جوهر تسور می‌کنم ولی این هم جواب درست نبود. اون گفت این تو رو یاد چی می‌اندازه – یه چیزی تخیل کن. من چشم‌هام رو برای یه مدت تولانی بستم تا تخیل کنم. گفتم یه خودکار فنری رو که جوهرش به رو‌میزی پس داده تخیل می‌کنم. بعد پا شدم و بیرون اومدم. فکر نمی‌کنم که تست تجسم اهساسی رو پاس کرده باشم. گذارش پیشرفط 3 – 7 مارسدکتر استراوس و دکتر «نمور» گفتند که نگران لکه ‌های جوهر نباشم. من بهشون گفتم که من جوهرها رو روی کارت‌ها نریختم و این که من نتونستم چیزی توی جوهرها ببینم. اون‌ها گفتند که شاید هنوز من رو استفاده کنند. من گفتم که خانم کینیان هیچ‌ وقت تست اون ‌توری به من نداده فقت املا و روخانی از من تست گرفته. اون‌ها گفتند که خانم کینیان گفته که من بهترین دانش‌آموز اون توی مدرسه ‌ی شبانه ‌ی بزرگسالان هستم چون من از همه بیشتر تلاش می‌کنم و واقعن دوست دارم که یاد بگیرم. اون‌ها پرسیدند چارلی چی شد که تو خودت به تنهایی به مدرسه‌ ی شبانه ‌ی بزرگسالان رفتی. چه‌توری اون رو پیدا کردی. گفتم از مردم پرسیدم و یه نفر بهم گفت کجا باید برم تا یاد بگیرم خوب بخونم و بنویسم. اون‌ها پرسیدند چرا می‌خای خوب بخونی و بنویسی. گفتم چون تموم زندگیم دلم می‌خاست باهوش باشم و اهمق نباشم. ولی این خیلی سخته که باهوش باشی. اون‌ها بهم گفتند می‌دونی که ممکنه موقتی باشه. گفتم آره. خانم کینیان بهم گفت. من اهمیت نمی‌دم که سدمه ببینمبعدش امروز بازهم یه تست اجیب ‌قریب داشتم. خانم خوبی که اون تست رو از من گرفت اسمش رو به من گفت و من ازش خاستم که املاش رو بهم بگه تا بتونم اون رو توی گذارش پیشرفطم بنویسم. تست درک احساس موضوعی. من نمی‌دونم سه تا کلمه ‌ی آخر چه معنی می‌ده ولی می‌دونم تست یعنی چی. آدم باید پاسش کنه وگرنه نمره‌ ی بد می‌گیره. این تست به نزر آسون می‌اومد چون من می‌تونستم اکس‌ها رو ببینم. ولی این دفعه اون از من نمی‌خاست که اکس‌ها رو براش بگم. این من رو گیج کرد. من بهش گفتم اون آقای دیروزی گفت من باید بهش بگم توی جوهرها چی میبینم اون گفت این هیچ تفاوتی ایجاد نمی‌کنه. اون از من خاست تا در مورد آدم‌های توی اکس‌ها داستان سرهم کنممن ازش پرسیدم آخه آدم چه‌تور می‌تونه در مورد آدم‌هایی که تا حالا ندیده داستان تریف کنه. چرا من باید دروق بسازم. من دیگه هیچ وقت دروق نمی‌گم چون همیشه دستم رو می‌شهاون به من گفت که این تست و اون تست دیگه –تجسم اهساسی– برای خسوسی شدنه. من به شدت خندیدم. گفتم آدم چه‌تور می‌تونه با لکه‌ ی جوهر و اکس خسوسی بشه. اون عسبانی شد و اکس‌هاش رو کنار گزاشت. به من چه. این کار اهمقانه ‌ای بود. فکر کنم اون تست رو هم افتادمچند وقت بعد یه سری مرد با روپوش‌های سفید من رو به یه قسمت دیگه ‌ی بیمارستان بردند و بهم یه بازی دادند تا بازی کنم. مسل یه مسابقه با یه موش سفید بود. اون‌ها موش رو الجرنون سدا می‌کردند. الجرنون توی یه جعبه با یه آلمه دیوارهای پرپیچ و تاب بود و اون‌ها به من یه مداد و یه کاقز پر از مستطیل و خط دادند. یه ترفش نوشته بود آغاز و ترف دیگه ‌اش نوشته بود پایان. اون‌ها گفتند که این هزارتاست و من و الجرنون هزارتای مشابهی رو باید انجام بدیم. من نفهمیدم چه‌تور ممکنه ما هزارتای مشابهی داشته باشیم در هالیکه الجرنون یه جعبه داشت ومن یه کاقز ولی چیزی نگفتم. به هرهال وقتی هم نبود که چیزی بگم چون مسابقه شروع شدیکی از مردها یه ساعت داشت که سعی می‌کرد قایمش کنه تا من نبینمش پس من سعی کردم بهش نگاه نکنم و این من رو عسبی کردبه هرهال اون تست باعس شد که من از همیشه اهساس بدتری بکنم چون اون‌ها بیشتر از ده بار با هزارتاهای متفاوت تکرارش کردند و الجرنون همه‌ ی دفعات رو برد. من نمی‌دونستم که موش‌ها این‌قدر باهوشند. شاید این به این خاتره که الجرنون یه موش سفیده. شاید موش‌های سفید از بقیه ‌ی موش‌ها باهوش‌ترند و...؛ ا. شربیانی"

       "The Outsiders, S.E. HintonThe Outsiders is a coming-of-age **novel** by S. E. Hinton, **first** published in 1967 by Viking Press. Hinton was 15 when she started **writing** the **novel** but did most of the **work** when she was 16 and a junior in high school. Hinton was 18 when the book was published. The book details the conflict between two rival gangs divided by their socioeconomic status: the working-class \"greasers\" and the upper-class \"Socs\" (short for Socials). The **story** is told in **first**-person perspective by teen aged protagonist Ponyboy Curtis. تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز بیست و پنجم ماه آگوست سال 2002 میلادیعنوان: حاشیه نشینان؛ نویسنده: اس.ای. هینتون؛ مترجم: نجمه فخرایی؛ ت‍ه‍ران‌: ه‍وای‌ ت‍ازه‌، 1380؛ در 175 ص؛ شابک: 9647222289؛ موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان امریکایی - سده 20 معنوان: غیر خودیها؛ نویسنده: اس.ای. هینتون؛ مترجم: میترا دانشور؛ تهران، انتشارات میلکان، در 184 ص؛ شابک: 9786008812012؛ حاشیه‌ نشینان در مورد مشکلات زندگی، سه برادر به نامهای: «دری»، «سودا» و «پونی‌بوی کورتیس»، در برخورد با تضاد طبقاتی، بین خرپول‌ها و روغنی‌ها ست. به باور «پونی‌بوی»، دو جور آدم در دنیا وجود دارند: «روغنی‌ها»، و «خرپول‌ها». خرپول‌ها پول و پله دارند، هرچه بخواهند بدست می‌آورند، و تکبرشان سر به آسمان می‌زند. از آن سوی دیگر، روغنی‌ها، همیشه در حاشیه‌ هستند، و باید هوای پشت‌ سرشان را داشته باشند. «پونی‌بوی» از روغنی‌هاست، و همیشه هم به این قضیه میبالیده، حتی به خاطر رفقای روغنی‌ خویش، علیه دار و دسته‌ ی خرپول‌ها، شاخ‌ و شانه می‌کشد ...؛ تا شبی وحشتناک که دوستش «جانی» خرپولی را می‌کشد. این آدمکشی بدجوری حال «پونی‌بوی» را بد می‌کند، و دنیای دودسته‌ ای ایشان را زیر و رو می‌کند، و به او می‌آموزد، چه خرپول باشی و چه روغنی، رنج درد مشترکی ست. «اس.ای هینتن» این داستان را، در دهه‌ ی شصت سده بیستم میلادی، و در سن پانزده‌ سالگی بنوشته است. نقل از یادداشت مترجم: «حاشيه‌ نشينان كتاب منتخب معلم انگليسی كلاس هفتم مدرسه‌ ی ما در تورنتو بود، اين كتاب پيشنهاد معلمی بود كه من هيچ‌وقت با او كلاسی نداشتم ....»؛ پایان نقل. ا. شربیانی"

A dread fell on them, even as they passed between the lines of ancient stones and so came to the Dimholt. There under the gloom of black trees that not even Legolas **could** **long** endure they found a hollow place opening at the mountain’s root, and right in their path stood a single mighty stone **like** a finger of doom. ... And so they came at last deep into the glen; and there stood a sheer wall of rock, and in the wall the Dark Door gaped before them **like** the mouth of night. Signs and figures were carved above its wide arch too dim to read, and fear flowed from it **like** a grey vapor.’On the nature of Man: ‘said Gimli. “It is **ever** so with things that Men begin: there is a frost in Spring, or a blight in Summer, and they fail of their promise.” “Yet seldom do they fail of their seed,” said Legolas. “And that will lie in the dust and rot to spring up again in times and places unlooked for.”’Sam on hope: ‘There, peeping among the cloud-wrack above a **dark** tor high up the mountains, Sam saw a white star twinkle for a while. The beauty of it smote his **heart**, as he looked up out of the forsaken land, and hope returned to him.

       "At last Frodo **could** go no further. They had climbed up a narrow shelving ravine, but they still had a **long** way to go before they **could** even come in sight of the last craggy ridge. 'I must rest now, Sam, and sleep if I can,' said Frodo. He looked about, but there seemed nowhere even for an animal to crawl into in this dismal country. At length, tired out, they slunk under a curtain of brambles that hung down **like** a mat over a low rock-face.There they sat and made such a meal as they **could**. Keeping back the precious lembas for the evil days ahead, they ate the half of what remained in Sam's bag of Faramir's provision: some dried fruit, and a small slip of cured meat; and they sipped some water. They had drunk again from the pools in the valley, but they were very thirsty again. There was a bitter tang in the air of Mordor that dried the mouth. When Sam thought of water even his hopeful spirit quailed. Beyond the Morgai there was the dreadful plain of Gorgoroth to cross.'Now you go to sleep first, Mr. Frodo,' he said. 'It's getting **dark** again. I reckon this day is nearly over.'Frodo sighed and was asleep almost before the **words** were spoken. Sam struggled with his own weariness, and he took Frodo's hand; and there he sat silent till deep night fell. Then at last, to keep himself awake, he crawled from the hiding-place and looked out. The land seemed full of creaking and cracking and sly noises, but there was no sound of voice or of foot. Far above the Ephel Duath in the West the night-sky was still dim and pale. There, peeping among the cloud-wrack above a **dark** top high up in the mountains, Sam saw a white star twinkle for a while. The beauty of it smote his **heart**, as he looked up out of the forsaken land, and hope returned to him. For **like** a shaft, clear and cold, the thought pierced him that in the end the Shadow was only a small and passing thing: there was **light** and high beauty for **ever** beyond its reach.4 1/2 stars"

This book is wonderful and so many of its descriptions are great.Gimli the Dwarf’s beginning description of Helm’s Deep: ‘...when the torches are kindled and **men** walk on the sandy floors under the echoing domes, then...gems and crystals and veins of precious ore glint in the polished walls; and the **light** glows through folded marbles, shell-**like**, translucent as the living hands of Queen Galadriel. There are columns of white and saffron and dawn-rose...fluted and twisted into dreamlike forms; they spring up from many-colored floors to meet the glistening pendants of the roof...’One more, on Shelob’s lair: ‘Here the air was still, stagnant, heavy, and sound fell dead. They walked as it were in black vapor wrought of veritable darkness itself that, as it breathed, brought blindness not only to the **eyes** but to the **mind**, so that even the memory of colours and of forms and of any **light** faded out of thought.’There is more goodness to the quotes above and many, many more besides but too **long** be enumerated here. Such an epic and wonderful story."

And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that flowered once for Dutch sailors’ **eyes**—a fresh, green breast of the new **world**. Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby’s house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment **man** must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an æsthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last **time** in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.And as I sat there, brooding on the old unknown **world**, I thought of Gatsby’s wonder when he first picked out the green **light** at the end of Daisy’s dock. He had come a **long** way to this blue lawn and his dream must have seemed so close that he **could** hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the **dark** fields of the republic rolled on under the night.Gatsby believed in the green **light**, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . . And **one** fine morning——So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."

Slowly, they begin assuming a shape and the empty spaces are filled in black with inherent thoughts emerging unbeaten on the surface.

       "Having known the films first, the original text did admittedly move along a bit more slowly than I had anticipated, but it was still very, very enjoyable. My favorite scene is a moment in which Frodo (and we as the reader) observe Aragorn at the foot of a hill in Lothlórien:standing still and silent as a tree; but in his hand was a small golden bloom of elanor, and a **light** was in his **eyes**. He was wrapped in some fair memory: and as Frodo looked at him he knew that he beheld things as they once had been in this same place. For the grim years were removed from the face of Aragorn, and he seemed clothed in white, a young lord tall and fair; and he spoke **words** in the Elvish tongue to **one** whom Frodo **could** not see. Arwen vanimelda, namarië! he said, and then he drew a breath, and returning out of his thought he looked at Frodo and smiled.'Here is the **heart** of Elvendom on earth,' he said, 'and here my **heart** dwells **ever**, unless there be a **light** beyond the **dark** roads that we still must tread, you and I. Come with me!' And taking Frodo's hand in his, he left the hill of Cerin Amroth and came there **never** again as a living **man**\" (366-367). I confess my **heart** swells a bit each **time** I read these lines!I also quite enjoyed the many songs and lines of poetry Tolkien included throughout the book. My favorite, of course, was a feature of a letter from Gandalf:\n",

       "A wonderfully descriptive and exceptionally well-written novel.Some of my favourite phrases:(in describing grief) \"Well, quite softly, **one** day following another, a spring on a winter, and and an autumn after a summer, this wore away, piece by piece, crumb by crumb; it passed away, it is gone, I should say it has sunk; for something always remains at the bottom as **one** **would** say --a weight here, at **one**'s **heart**.\"\"Then there came forward on the platform a little old woman with timid bearing, who seemed to shrink within her poor clothes. On her feet she wore heavy wooden clogs, and from her hips hung a large blue apron. Her pale face framed in a borderless cap was more wrinkled than a withered russet apple. And from the sleeves of her red jacket looked out two large hands with knotty joints, the dust of barns, the potash of washing the grease of wools had so encrusted, roughened, hardened these that they seemed dirty, although they had been rinsed in clear water; and by dint of **long** service they remained half open, as if to bear humble witness for themselves of so much suffering endured. Something of monastic rigidity dignified her face. Nothing of sadness or of emotion weakened that pale look.\"\"They heard the chiming of bells, the neighing of mules, together with the murmur of guitars and the noise of fountains, whose rising spray refreshed heaps of fruit arranged **like** a pyramid at the foot of pale statues that smiled beneath playing waters.\"\"The nave was reflected in the full fonts with the beginning of the arches and some portions of the glass windows. But the reflections of the paintings, broken by the marble rim, were continued farther on **upon** the flag-stones, **like** a many-coloured carpet. The broad daylight from without streamed into the church in three enormous rays from the three opened portals. From **time** to **time** at the upper end a sacristan passed, making the oblique genuflexion of devout persons in a hurry. The crystal lustres hung motionless. In the choir a silver lamp was burning, and from the side chapels and **dark** places of the church sometimes rose sounds **like** sighs, with the clang of a closing grating, its echo reverberating under the lofty vault.\""

Of my kindAre you too – a hapless flower from a beloved's hair. Frail fingers wouldn't take you to a soft face so close,Nor **would** you be kissed by lips delicate and rose.”With a silent smile the flower replied, “Don't lose **heart**!This desert I wouldn't give up for the gardens of Iran,A solitary I am here while legions are there,Amidst this cursed soil I stand apart. In this gray desert, a flamboyant flame of divine **light** am I,Beauty's silent song, a miracle from the sky.In your garden, there are thousands of flowers **like** meIn this gray desert, a flamboyant flame of divine **light** am I,Beauty's silent song, a miracle from the sky.In your garden, there are thousands of flowers **like** me –A nameless droplet in a nameless sea.You too, in your desert, don't feel forlorn,To behold you at last shall come a sore Ghani Khan.[End of Poem]I wonder if either **one** of them inspired the other with the theme.

He thought he might be able to find it, in his **mind** he **could** picture just where it was on a page. He started flipping through … stopped … and read …Spring was **long** in coming. For the last weeks of Lent the weather had been clear and frosty. By day it thawed in the sun, and at night there were seven degrees of frost; the crust of snow was so hard that the peasants drove about on their carts without keeping to the roads. It was a white Easter. Then suddenly, on Easter Monday, a warm wind began to blow, the clouds gathered, and for three days and three nights heavy, warm rain came down in torrents. On Thursday the wind subsided, and a thick gray mist covered the countryside, as if to conceal the mysteries of the changes that were taking place in nature. In the mist the flood waters flowed, the ice flows began to crack and moved down the rivers, and the turbid, foaming torrents flowed faster, until on the following Monday, toward evening, the mist dispersed, the sky was covered with fleecy clouds and then cleared, and real spring had come. In the morning the bright sun rose and quickly devoured the thin ice covering the water, and the warm air all around vibrated with the exhalations of the reviving earth. The old grass turned green again and the young grass thrust out its needle-sharp blades, the buds swelled on the guilder-rose, the currant bushes, and the sticky, resinous birch trees; and in the gold-besprinkled willows the honey bee, which had only just emerged from its hive, flew about humming. Invisible larks broke into song over the velvet of the young, sprouting corn and the ice-covered stubble; peewits began to cry over the marshes and the low reaches of the rivers and streams, still overflowing with brownish water, and cranes and wild geese flew high across the sky, uttering their loud, spring cries. The cattle, their winter coats only partly shed and bald in patches, began to low in the pastures; bandy-legged lambs frisked round their bleating mothers, who were losing their fleece; swift-footed children ran about the quickly-drying paths marked with imprints of bare feet; the merry voices of peasant women rose over the pond; and the axes of the peasants repairing their ploughs and harrows rang in the yard. Real spring had come.\n",
       "Yes. He softly drew a line, in pencil, down the side of the passage, and lightly circled the page … 164.Some years passed. He read Anna a second **time**. Smiled when he came to the circled page number. Again felt spring. More years passed. He read a review of the book by a friend. Again, he descended into the basement, took the book down. Not sure that he had marked the passage, he stood near the bottom of the stairs, flipping pages too quickly, missing it the first **time**, finally realizing that it couldn’t have been so deep into the bulk of the book, going back, slower. Saw a few faint pencil markings, became sure that it must be marked, and then did find it …And later, thought that he should read it once more. At least try to fit it in again. The first of the great novels he’d read."

Τι κρύβεται όμως πίσω από ένα μιούζικαλ που παίζεται διαρκώς εδώ και 25 χρόνια, έχει αναδείξει δεκάδες ηθοποιούς, έχει μεταφερθεί στον κινηματογράφο, ενώ το παραπάνω κομμάτι το έχουμε ακούσει σε metal διασκευή από τους Nightwish (που τους ακούω φανατικά https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VgLK...) και σε μια πιο «τρελιάρικη» εκδοχή από τη Lindsey Stirling (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCL94...)Κρύβεται ένα μεγαλειώδες βιβλίο.Γραμμένο το 1910, αποτελεί ορισμό του **dark** romance, του καταραμένου έρωτα, του gothic, του θρίλερ, του τρόμου. Η λυρική γλώσσα και οι πολυδιάστατοι χαρακτήρες, μαγεύουν τον αναγνώστη, ο οποίος ακολουθεί τους ήρωες σε ένα ταξίδι δίχως γυρισμό στις κατακόμβες της Όπερας του Παρισιού, ανάμεσα σε λαβύρινθους, σκοτεινές παγίδες, αίθουσες βασανιστηρίων, πολυτελή θεωρεία, σκονισμένες σοφίτες, και όλα αυτά με πολλή μουσική. Διάβολε, την καλύτερη μουσική, από τους καλύτερους τραγουδιστές στο καλύτερο μέρος. «Turn your face away from the garish **light** of dayTurn your face away from cold, unfeeling lightAnd listen to the music of the nightClose you **eyes** and surrender to your darkest dreamsLeave all thoughts of the **world** you knew beforeClose your **eyes**, let your spirit start to soarAnd you'll live as you've **never** lived before…………………………………………..Open up your **mind**, let your fantasies unwindIn this darkness which you know you cannot fightThe darkness of the music of the night»Πολυτέλεια, πλούτος, ταλέντο, μεγαλοφυΐα σε απόλυτο συνδυασμό με το σκοτάδι, την τρέλα, την παράνοια, με background την Όπερα του Παρισιού.Τι είναι τελικά το φάντασμα; Μεγαλοφυΐα, μέντορας, απόβλητος, άσχημος, μεγαλόκαρδος, παρανοϊκός ή απλά ερωτευμένος με τη ζωή που επιθυμούσε να ζήσει;“Angel of music, guide and guardian, grant me to your glory”Και όταν πέφτουν οι μάσκες και αποκαλύπτεται η αλήθεια, πόσο εύκολο είναι να τιναχτούν όλα στον αέρα; Τι είναι ικανό να σταματήσει τη μανία;«Past the point of no return, no backward glancesThe games of make believe are at an endPast all thought of if or when, no use resistingAbandon thought and let the dream descend»Τίνος είναι τελικά η αυτοθυσία; Μαγευτείτε άφοβα\n",
       "«And in this labyrinthwhere night is blindthe Phantom of the Opera is there/here,inside my/your mindSing, my Angel of music! Sing»\n",
       "ΥΓ. Συγνώμη που χρησιμοποιώ στίχους του μιούζικαλ, αλλά αν άφηνα τον εαυτό μου να γράψει τι σκεφτόταν, νομίζω ότι θα πέρναγαν από το μυαλό μου εικόνες του βιβλίου και στο πληκτρολόγιο απλά θα έγραφα wow!Επειδή οι περισσότεροι θα έχετε δει την κινηματογραφική εκδοχή (αν δεν την είδατε να τη δείτε), προτείνω επίσης το θεατρικό του Λονδίνου (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2077886/?...), εκτός αν το έχετε δει ζωντανά και θέλετε να μοιραστείτε τις εντυπώσεις σας! Θυμηθείτε όμως πως σαν το βιβλίο δεν έχει!!!"

For others they sail forever on the horizon, Never out of sight, Never landing until the Watcher turns his **eyes** away in resignation, His dreams mocked to death by Time. That is the **life** of **men**.So begins Their Eyes Were Watching God. It’s not actually written in verse - but it hardly seems to be prose either. The language is almost too lush and rich in metaphors to be merely a novel: Death, that strange being with the huge square toes who lived way in the West. The great **one** who lived in the straight house **like** a platform without sides to it, and without a roof. What need has Death for a cover, and what winds can blow against him? He stands in his high house that overlooks the **world**. Stands watchful and motionless all day with his sword drawn back, waiting for the messenger to bid him come. Been standing there before there was a where or a when or a then. Look at this again: Death has square toes. He lives in a house without sides nor a roof. It’s way in the west, and it towers over us. And he just stands there motionless all day with his sword in hand waiting to strike. He has done so since before **time** began. This has to be the most chilling description of Death **ever** - forget all that stuff about skeletons in black robes carrying scythes. And then there’s the wonderful rural Southern black dialect. Dat wuz uh mighty fine thing. It’s a bit hard to read at first, but believe me, by the end you’ll be talkin’ lak dat too."

Along the way we encounter the brave and truehearted riders of Rohan, a once-magnificent king who must be risen from his diseased stupor, a fair maiden who can hold fort with the best and mightiest of **men**, ancient talking trees who hem and haw but ultimately get cracking, **one** helluva gorgeous white horse, a schizophrenic creature of the **dark**, a tall ranger who is fair in demeanor and deed and a great big nasty, stinkin' spider.\n",
       "The Two Towers\n",
       " is an exhausting read. After a point of **time**, I actually felt that I was bone-weary with fatigue as I trudged along with two stout hobbits on the trip from hell. But just when I want to throw up my hands in exasperation (**never** a wise move, when you have a 1,178-page-strong book in said hands), the plot reins me in. I want to know if Merry and Pippin survive an Orc-kidnapping . I most definitely want Saruman to get a rap on his gnarly knuckles for being such a bearded-meanie. I want to see Aragorn rock the legendary Andúril **like** the rockstar that he is. I want to bite at that niggling hangnail as I wonder if Frodo's goodness will lead to his downfall. But above all, I need to know that the loyal and brave Samwise Gamgee gets a hot, decent meal in the land of Sauron.So yes, I laboured on. And in my head, my fingernails are crusty with Orc-dirt and my feet are covered with blisters from walking over hill and through tunnel and my back is groaning for a **long**, hot soak. And if a book and it's **words** can evoke these feelings in an armchair reader, I am happy that I finished such a book.---------Being the sentimental fangirl that I am, I give you the moments that will forever stay with me:Pg.No.413A mile, maybe, from Parth Galen in a little glade not far from the lake he found Boromir. He was sitting with his back to a great tree, as if he was resting. But Aragorn saw that he was pierced with many black-feathered arrows; his sword was still in his hand, but it was broken near the hilt; his horn cloven in two at his side. Many Orcs lay slain, piled all about him and at his feet.---------Pg.No.414'Farewell, Aragorn! Go to Minas Tirith and save my people! I have failed.'No!' said Aragorn, taking his hand and kissing his brow. 'You have conquered. Few have gained such a victory. Be at peace! Minas Tirith shall not fall!'---------Pg.No.415'Then let us lay him in a boat with his weapons, and the weapons of his vanquished foes,' said Aragorn. 'We will send him to the Falls of Rauros and give him to Anduin. The River of Gondor will take care at least that no evil creature dishonours his bones.'---------Pg.No.420'Forth the Three Hunters!'---------Pg.No.430'They are proud and wilful, but they are true-hearted, generous in thought and deed; bold but not cruel; wise but unlearned, writing no books but singing many songs, after the manner of the children of Men before the Dark Years.' ~ARAGORN---------Pg.No.433Aragorn threw back his cloak. The elven-sheath glittered as he grasped it, and the bright blade of Andúril shone **like** a sudden flame as he swept it out. ‘Elendil!’ he cried. ‘I am Aragorn son of Arathorn, and am called Elessar, the Elfstone, Dúnadan, the heir of Isildur Elendil’s son of Gondor. Here is the Sword that was broken and is forged again! Will you aid me or thwart me? Choose swiftly!’---------Pg.No.462These deep **eyes** were now surveying them, slow and solemn, but very penetrating. They were brown, shot with a green **light**. Often afterwards Pippin tried to describe his first impression of them.'One felt as if there was an enormous well behind them, filled up with ages of memory and **long**, slow, steady thinking; but their surface was sparkling with the present; **like** sun shimmering on the outer leaves of a vast tree, or on the ripples of a deep lake.---------Pg.No.474His hood and his grey rags were flung away. His white garments shone. He lifted up his staff, and Gimli’s axe leaped from his grasp and fell ringing on the ground. The sword of Aragorn, stiff in his motionless hand, blazed with a sudden fire. Legolas gave a great shout and shot an arrow high into the air: it vanished in a flash of flame.They all gazed at him. His hair was as white as snow in the sunshine; and gleaming white was his robe; the **eyes** under his deep brows were bright, piercing as the rays of the sun; power was in his hand.---------Pg.No.501\"And this I also say: you are our captain and our banner. The Dark Lord has Nine. But we have One, mightier than they : the White Rider. He has passed through the fire and the abyss, and they shall fear him. We will go where he leads. \" ~ARAGORN---------Pg.No.504'This is Shadowfax. He is the chief of the Mearas, lords of horses, and not even Theoden, King of Rohan, has **ever** looked on a better. Does he not shine **like** silver, and run as smoothly as a swift stream? He has come for me: the horse of the White Rider. We are going to battle together.' ~GANDALF---------Pg.No.515Thus Aragorn for the first **time** in the full **light** of day beheld Éowyn , Lady of Rohan.---------Pg.No.515---------Pg.No.517Forth Eorlingas!---------Pg.Nos. 522-523As she stood before Aragorn she paused suddenly and looked **upon** him, and her **eyes** were shining. And he looked down **upon** her fair face and smiled; but as he took the cup, his hand met hers, and he knew that she trembled at the touch. ‘Hail Aragorn son of Arathorn!’ she said. ‘Hail Lady of Rohan!’ he answered, but his face now was troubled, and he did not smile.---------Pg.No.523Alone Eowyn stood before the doors of the house at the stair’s head; the sword was set upright before her, and her hands were laid **upon** the hilt. She was clad now in mail and shone **like** silver in the sun.---------Pg.No. 540'Helm! Helm!' the Riders shouted. 'Helm is arisen and comes back to war. Helm for Théoden King!'And with that shout the king came. His horse was white as snow, golden was his shield, and his spear was **long**. At his right hand was Aragorn, Elendil’s heir, behind him rode the lords of the House of Eorl the Young.Light sprang in the sky. Night departed.---------Pg.No.541There suddenly **upon** a ridge appeared a rider, clad in white, shining in the rising sun. ---------Pg.No.580'We will have peace,' said Theoden. 'We will have peace, when you and all your works have perished —- and the works of your **dark** master to whom you **would** deliver us. You are a liar, Saruman, and a corrupter of **men**'s hearts. When you hang from a gibbet at your window for the sport of your own crows, I will have peace with you and Orthanc.'---------Pg.No.583'Behold, I am not Gandalf the Grey, whom you betrayed. I am Gandalf the White, who has returned from death. You have no colour now, and I cast you from the order and from the Council.'He raised his hand, and spoke slowly in a clear cold voice. ‘Saruman, your staff is broken.’ There was a crack, and the staff split asunder in Saruman’s hand, and the head of it fell down at Gandalf’s feet. ‘Go!,’ said Gandalf. ------------------Pg.No.594Gandalf looked at Aragorn, and then, to the surprise of the others, he lifted the covered Stone, and bowed as he presented it.'Receive it, lord!' he said: 'in earnest of other things that shall be given back. But if I may counsel you in the use of your own, do not use it - yet! Be wary!'---------Pg.No. 665Faramir turned to Frodo again. ‘You asked how do I know that the son of Denethor is dead. Tidings of death have many wings. Night oft brings news to near kindred, ‘tis said. Boromir was my brother.’---------Pg.No.672---------Pg.No.712'But you have left out **one** of the chief characters : Samwise the stouthearted.\"Frodo wouldn’t have got far without Sam, **would** he, dad?\"’---------Pg.No. 728Sam did not wait to wonder what was to be done, or whether he was brave, or loyal, or filled with rage. He sprang forward with a yell, and seized his master’s sword in his left hand. Then he charged. No onslaught more fierce was **ever** seen in the savage **world** of beasts, where some desperate small creature armed with little teeth, alone, will spring **upon** a tower of horn and hide that stands above its fallen mate.---------Pg.No. 730'Frodo, Mr.Frodo!' he called. 'Don't leave me here alone! It's your Sam calling. Don't go where I can't follow!'---------"

       "Revisiting The Heart of DarknessAfter passing past that Castle of Ego,Laying siege on the very borders of Mind,We entered the vast and bristling forests,Of that strange, strange land, that Id,Which doth divide the knowing, waking,From the land of dreaming, unknowing.But this way is much too hard to follow;And is harder even to describe to you:We are more likely here to perish,Here in these vast, dense hinterlands;For these woods that we see arrayed,Has **never** previously been crossed,By mortal **men** or by Gods before,Except by the Duke, on his missions,To plunder and to subjugate.He had sliced a path so wide and true,For himself and his army vast,Marking along the trees as he trode,Deeper and deeper into these woods,Holding fast to his own marks,And to the crude compasses of his day,Wary of the beasts and birds,And of **dark** shadows of the serpents,And the importunities of bugs and bites.Vexed he was by silence and **dark**,But angered more by lonely shrieks.So we move on in this path of old;Those old trees that the Duke had marked,Now but marshy ground to mire our carts,When will we cross these woods so **dark**,And reach the sparkle at the other end?That river which we truly seek,That drowned the Duke and freed the Mind:That river so cool, called Sanity."

       " A **man** from whose tongue the speech flowed sweeter than honey.(1.249)My fame will **never** perish. . . immortal and ageless for all eternity. (7.91, 12.323)__________. . . his black **heart** brimming overwith rage, while his **eyes** have the semblance of blazing fire (1.103-104)__________The first translation of the Iliad I read was Fagles'. For round two I decided on something more modern. The main reason for this was that I kept coming across quotes that read as very modern, and I was surprised to find that the source was Homer. I spent a **long** **time** looking through many translations before deciding on Peter Green's, and it did not disappoint.Not only do I think this more modern translation is easier to follow than older ones (making it ideal for a first reading), the modernity provides a more \"cutting\" and forceful rendering of the poetry.A final reason which contributed to my enjoyment of Green's translation:\n",
       "To **one** nagging minor problem, the spelling of Greek proper names, I have found no altogether satisfactory solution, and probably none exists. The problem itself is **one** legacy of Rome’s complete cultural domination of the European classical tradition from the Renaissance until well into the nineteenth century, which dictated (among much else), not only that Greek names be Latinized, but that the gods of the Greek pantheon should be replaced in translation by their nearest Roman equivalents . . . For the most part, I have gone back to the Greek spelling. In a majority of cases this does not make for a wrenching familiarity. The shift . . . can be disconcerting, and there are some Hellenisms that take some getting used to. But **one** has to start getting rid of this wretched Latin legacy somewhere.\n",
       "My first exposure to Greek Mythology was Graves' The Greek Myths, in which I remember him calling the Goddess Athene, not Athena. Green goes further, reinstalling for the most part the Greek over the Latinised names of Gods and Places, adding accents as well: Aias not Ajax, Hekabē not Hecuba, Mykēnai not Mycenae.All this aids a suffusion of Hellenism to the poem, as a translation should, but without attempting this via the translation itself; thus helping the reader to feel that much closer to Ancient Greece, whilst providing a modern, forceful translation and experience.His translation also comes with detailed synopses of each book, and an expansive glossary. Highly recommended.__________He made great Olympos tremble. (1.530). . . don’t permitforgetfulness to seize you when honey-sweet sleep lets you go. (2.33-34)The girls with lovely hair . . .

He guessed as well as he **could**, and crawled along for a good way, till suddenly his hand met what felt **like** a tiny ring of cold metal lying on the floor of the tunnel.

       "The moon methinks looks with a wat’ry eye;And when she weeps, weeps **every** little flower”(Titania)Tomorrow night, when Phoebe doth beholdHer silver visage in the watery glass,Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass.So quick bright things come to confusion(Lysander)Night and the ocean are the depthless things of the earth, where bright things come to confusion, become “undistinguishable, Like far-off mountains turned to clouds”. The unconscious, the sleep-**world**, the dream-**world**. Everywhere throughout A Midsummer Night’s Dream the moon and water rule. Oberon’s **world** glimmers with moonstruck dew and the night’s wet flowers, dripping with the stuff of irreality- its residue permeates the stage. And what else sends a plague of fantasies across our minds? Love, jealousy, madness. “More strange than true”. “The forms of things unknown, the poet’s pen turns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing A local habitation and a name.” Because works of literature too are dreams, are fevered fantasies we inhabit strangely and temporarily **like** the other plane of the sleep-**world**. All of this is awaiting, well-prepared, as we enter A Midsummer Night’s Dream; Shakespeare has composed a universe with depths as deep-reaching as the Atlantic, the great Bottomless expanse to the west, over which Oberon once watched Cupid’s arrow arc.The lights come down in the theater. We are momentarily encapsulated in complete dusk. Before sleep our **eyes** are shuttered completely, and what power draws us into that black? Like a fairy’s flower working its magic. Our still bodies become vessels of the visions of that other **world**, and what happens there, on the stage, of little consequence to our physicality, an animated vision drawn and protracted out in rhythms, figures, symbols as old as language itself. The dream of the stage, the dream of the novel, dream of **life**.That the primary concerns of A Midsummer Night’s Dream are love, confusion, jealousy, and agency, are uniquely appropriate to this fantasy. Strong desire creates another irreality, unrequited desire creates distorted reality, jealousy tells its horrible lies to us, and our thoughts and bodies seem animated by some will other than our own. Is passion but a spell cast on us, twisting reason and sense, where we pursue our desired object astonished and half-blind, **like** in a dream? And the absurdities of our delusions in desire, are they not but the stuff of the utmost comedy?The influence of the full moon is the stuff of legend, myth, but also of proven fact. Agency. Magic. The moon exerts itself on the earth’s bodies of water, pulling them inland and out. The moon-mad howl in the bright night. In the forests shapeless things delineate themselves by the watery **light** of the moon. The glitter of dew on leaves glimmers **like** ice. Fairies carry little lights in the palms of their hands and lay us down to sleep on thyme and eglantine covered bowers. Love-in-idleness is dripped across the sleeping lovers’ brows. When Cupid’s potion has been administered, the love-mad are sent into frenzies at their waking sight.Men are the clowns of this earth, so all of this is very funny. All of this is very gentle and star-**light** and ephemeral and fleeting. As dew dries quickly once the morning has ascended, our dreams dissipate, and only through great effort do we keep them. Love too is brief and comes quickly to confusion, and our mercurial love that **one** day seems the direst need soon seems the most innocent delusion. As if we were players in a ridiculous play. A farce or satire of something more serious. Nick Bottom and Francis Flute and Tom Snout and Snug and Robin Starveling make a foolish thing of a deadly serious affair in their play within this play- they do no less than satirize **one** of their Master’s own masterworks, Romeo and Juliet. And the ass-headed weaver Nick Bottom, dreamer so deep that his body is lost, lover of the Faerie Queene, is the hammiest actor of them all. Those who fall deepest into their fantasies are the most foolish. But also the most fun to watch because they are, at least for the moment, other than us.In the end Puck sweeps away the dream dust. The dew-soaked stage by morning **light** is littered with the debris of the night’s phantasmagoria. The motes of **man**’s dreams of love are scattered and dispersed, and from the forest they have come to be with their true lovers, the events of the midsummer’s night dimly recalled as chimeras. The tragedy of love, love-in-death, the sorrows of Romeo and Juliet, are far from here; in A Midsummer Night’s Dream they are only the fools’ ill-prepared debacle of a play. Here there is no death, all is **life**, all is dream, the human comedy playing itself out, swimming before our slumbering **eyes**.Oberon. Thou rememb’restSince once I sat **upon** a promontoryAnd heard a mermaid on a dolphin’s backUttering such dulcet and harmonious breathThat the rude sea grew civil at her song,And certain stars shot madly from their spheres,To hear the sea-maid’s music?Robin.I remember."

       "An excellent translation of the classic and highly recommended. I've put down my thoughts of the poem elsewhere but here I wanted to illustrate the differences between the three versions I've read in full [unfortunately, I did not follow my Greek studies far enough to **ever** attempt reading The Iliad in the original language]. Between Alexander, Fagles & Mitchell, I'm leaning toward Alexander as my favorite but it's only by a hair over Fagles. Below are a representative example from each author:Then god-born Achilles left his spear on the bank / propped against the tamarisks, and leapt in **like** / someone more than human, / gripping his sword, intent in his **heart** on **dark** deeds, / he struck, turning this side and that; abject groaning rose from those / stricken by his sword, and the water was made red with blood. (Alexander, 21.17-21)And the god-sprung hero left his spear on the bank / propped on tamarisks - in he leapt **like** a frenzied god, / his **heart** racing with slaughter, only his sword in hand, / whirling in circles, slashing - hideous groans breaking, / fighters stabbed by the blade, water flushed with blood. (Fagles, 21.20-24)Achilles left his spear on the riverbank, leaning / against a tamarisk. Then, in a frenzy, he jumped in / with his naked sword, and with butchery in his **heart** / he laid about him, slashing in all directions, / and hideous screams arose from the **men** being hacked / and maimed and killed, and the water was / red with blood. (Mitchell, 21.17-22) "

This is but half the truth. You are also as strong as your strongest link.\"\"Even those who limp go not backward.\"\"It is enough that you enter the temple invisible.\"\"Beauty is eternity gazing at itself in a mirror.

In both countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes, that things in general were settled for **ever**.Page 10:A wonderful fact to reflect **upon**, that **every** human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to **every** other. A solemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that **every** **one** of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that **every** room in **every** **one** of them encloses its own secret; that **every** beating **heart** in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there, is, in some of its imaginings, a secret to the **heart** nearest it!Page 25:The **time** was to come, when that wine too **would** be spilled on the street-stones, and when the stain of it **would** be red **upon** many there.Page 79:Sadly, sadly, the sun rose; it rose **upon** no sadder sight than the **man** of good abilities and good emotions, incapable of their directed exercise, incapable of his own help and his own happiness, sensible of the blight on him, and resigning himself to let it eat him away.Page 93:The leprosy of unreality disfigured **every** human creature in attendance **upon** Monseigneur.Page 97:The water of the fountain ran, the swift river ran, the day ran into evening, so much **life** in the city ran into death according to rule, **time** and tide waited for no **man**, the rats were sleeping close together in their **dark** holes again, the Fancy Ball was lighted up at supper, all things ran their course.Page 331:Crush humanity out of shape once more, under similar hammers, and it will twist itself into the same tortured forms. Sow the same seed of rapacious license and oppression over again, and it will surely yield the same fruit according to its kind.Page 335:\"It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have **ever** done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have **ever** known.\"I read many books on the French Revolution but Dickens was able to write a splendid and unforgettable book about this tragic historical period."

       "Before reading this, I had no idea how much this sweet little book **would** touch my **heart** and I am so happy I've finally read The Secret Garden.  '...And there she was standing on the grass, which seemed to have turned green, and with the sun pouring down on her and warm, sweet wafts about her and the fluting and twittering and singing coming from **every** bush and tree. She clasped her hands for pure joy and looked up in the sky, and it was so blue and pink and pearly and white and flooded with springtime **light** that she felt she must flute and sing aloud herself, and knew that thrushes and robins and skylarks **could** not possibly help it.' First off, the writing. It's spectacular. I adore descriptive language but reading **never** felt **like** an info dump, for me it had the perfect mix of dialogue and stunning descriptions of flowers and characters. Perhaps the run on sentences will annoy some, but it reminds me of someone so excited to describe they couldn't stop for a breath. There's something completely charming about that.And each character brought their own element to the story, how **could** anyone dislike sweet woodland fairy-child Dickon? On a personal level, I found a lot of myself in Mary and even a degree of Colin. Colin's epiphany about his illness really hit me, because I have a chronic illness and the most important thing is to look towards the beauty and good things **life** has to offer, instead of shutting the **world** out. 'The Secret Garden was what Mary called it when she was thinking of it. She liked the name, and she liked still more the feeling that when its beautiful old walls shut her in, no **one** knew where she was. It seemed almost **like** being shut out of the **world** in some fairy place.' I think this book hit home because throughout the year I've used gardening as a way to better both my mental health and physical health, a tough year that has brought a garden filled with flowers and vegetables. Don't be **like** Colin in the first half, let yourself grow. 'And over walls and earth and trees and swinging sprays and tendrils the fair green veil of tender little leaves had crept, and in the grass under the trees and the grey urns in the alcoves and here and there everywhere, were touches or splashes of gold and purple and white and the trees were showing pink and snow above his head, and there were fluttering of wings and faint sweet pipes and humming and scents and scents. And the sun fell warm **upon** his face **like** a hand with a lovely touch... \"I shall get well! I shall get well!' he cried out. \"And I shall live for **ever** and **ever** and **ever**!\"'The inexplicable truth of this novel is that there is so much beauty to be found around us, when we open our **eyes** to it.  Where you tend a rose, my lad,A thistle cannot grow "

For instance there's this passage, in which Madame Bovary and her **one** day lover Leon are strolling together, in a romantic scene that is actually quite run down if you pay attention to the language: \"The privets were in bloom, as were the veronica, the dog roses, the nettles, and the slim brambles thrusting forth from bushes. Through the gaps in the hedges **could** be seen, outside the huts, pigs on the manure heap and some tethered cows rubbing their horns against the tree trunks. The two of them walked leisurely side by side, she leaning on his arm and he adjusting his pace to hers. A swarm of flies buzzed before them in the warm air.\""

It's been my experience that you can nearly always enjoy things if you make up your **mind** that you will. Of course, you must make it up firmly. I am not going to think about going back to the asylum while we're having our drive. I'm just going to think about the drive. Oh, look, there's **one** little early wild rose out! Isn't is lovely? Don't you think it **would** be nice if roses **could** talk? I'm sure they **would** tell us such lovely things. And isn't pink the most bewitching color in the **world**? I love it, but I can't wear it. Redheaded people can't wear pink, not even in imagination. Did you **ever** know of anybody whose hair was red when she was young, but got to be another color when she grew up?\"Page 123 ...\"I'm so glad I live in a **world** where there are Octobers. It **would** be terrible if we just skipped from September to November, wouldn't it? Look at these maple branches. Don't they give you a thrill-several thrills?\"...I just love the writing in general...the choice of **words** is splendidPage 116 ....\"But spruce groves are seductive and yellow nuts of gum beguiling...Page 147 \"The warning seemed not unnecessary, so uplifted and aerial was Anne's expression and attitude as she sprang to her feet, her face irradiated with the flame of her spirit.\"Page 285 \"But Anne with her elbows on the window sill, her soft cheek laid against her clasped hands, and her **eyes** filled with visions, looked out unheedingly across city roof and spire to that glorious dome of sunset sky and wove her dreams of a possible future from the golden tissue of youth's own optimism. All the beyond was hers with its possibilities lurking rosily in the oncoming years-each year a rose of promise to be woven into an immortal chaplet.\"Page 261 \"Anne was sitting at her open window, for the **time** forgetful of the woes of examinations and the cares of the **world**, as she drank in the beauty of the summer dusk, sweet-scented with flower-breaths from the garden below and sibilant and rustling from the stirs of poplars. The eastern sky above the firs was flushed faintly pink from the reflection of the west, and Anne was wondering dreamily if the spirit of color looked **like** that, when she saw Diana come flying down through the firs, over the log bridge, and up the slope, with a fluttering newspaper in her hand.\"The descritions of nature cannot be beat...Page 147 \"Anne came dancing home in the purple winter twilight across the snowy places. Afar in the southwest wwas the great shimmering, pearl-**like** sparkle of an evening star in a sky that was pale golden and ethereal rose over gleaming white spaces and **dark** glens of spruce. The tinkles of sleigh bells among the snowy hills came **like** elfin chimes through the frosty aie, but their music was not seeter than the song in Anne's **heart** and on her lips.\"Page 271 \"Oh, it was good to be out agin in the purity and silence of the night! How great and still and wonderful everything was, with the murmur of the sea sounding through it and the darkling cliffs beyond **like** grim giants guarding enchanted coasts.\"Page 123 \"October was a beautiful month at Green Gables, when the birches in the hollow turned as golden as sunshine and the maples behind the orchard were royal crimson and the wild cherry trees along the lane put on the loveliest shades of **dark** red and bronzy green, while the fields sunned themselves in aftermaths.\"And of course, how **could** you not love Anne's wisdom on the subject of growing up...Page 233 \"That's the worst of growing up, and I'm begining to realize it. The things you wanted so much when you were a child don't seem half so wonderful to you when you get them.\"Page 251 \"But dare I say ther'll be other things to worry me. They keep coming up new all the **time**-things to perplex you, you know. You settle on question and there's another right after. There are so many things to be thought over and decided when you're begining to grow up. It keeps me busy all the **time** thinking them over and deciding whats right.

       "I don’t call myself a Dickens fan, for I’ve not read all his works and of those that I had, I found myself wandering often than not to other matters away from the **words** in endless swarm **upon** the page. I enjoyed David Copperfield, true, for the portrayal of the title character’s abuse in his childhood; so vividly was the picture painted by the author that I suffered along with David at the hand of his cruel aunt. The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby, on the other hand, I dropped not even a quarter through the book having found it quite the bore (at least for the **time**). Oh, but for the past several days I have bore the weight of Dickens in my womb, in my **heart**, in my **mind**, in my soul. My **eyes** were bleeding Dickens. My tongue was speaking Dickens. My hand was writing Dickens. Everything before me was Dickens.From the moment I awoke to the resting hour of sleep at night I was **one** with Dickens. I was **one** with Dickens! Oh, but with pleasure I carried the heaviness **upon** my person, my **mind** and soul to contemplate **every** waking moment of my days, hours, minutes, seconds. How useless is that to explain the glory in mere small **words** that, with **time**, shall, too, lose their vigor and stature as I shall lose by person to the spirits: the hour of my wake is the hour of my death. I walked to La Guillotine. I faced the terror. I fought with the best of them. I was in love. I was in death. I shed the tears. I rejoiced in triumphs. I recited the prayers. I cursed the villains. Oh, how my vision to all else was blurred in the smoke! Oh, how sharp was the pang to the **heart** at each betrayal! Oh, how hopeless all else! Yes, I was **one** with Dickens, again, again, and **ever** more. I was everything forever and endlessly so. And I was **one** without. For whatever satisfaction I gathered from this reading, I know that Dickens will remain a much too verbose friend to conquer again. And conquer him I wish not, at least not at the present. The adventure was grand; the moments superb; shadows unrelenting; and echoes frightening and lingering through Time and History undying. I am a far, far better **man** to have known it; I am a far, far better **mind** to have endured it."

       "Oh the balcony scene...that was perfection. Maybe I'm a romantic at **heart**, or maybe I'm a sucker for some beautiful lines. In fact, I'm going to include that whole scene here, to remind everyone who's read it just how wonderful it is and to show those who haven't tried Shakespeare before, that there's nothing to fear from language **like** this - Scene II. Capulet's Garden.[Enter Romeo.]Romeo.He jests at scars that **never** felt a wound.[Juliet appears above at a window.]But soft, what **light** through yonder window breaks?It is the east and Juliet is the sun! Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,Who is already sick and pale with grief That thou her maid art far more fair than she.Be not her maid, since she is envious;Her vestal livery is but sick and green, And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.It is my lady, O, it is my love! (10)O that she knew she were!She speaks, yet she says nothing; what of that?Her eye discourses, I will answer it. I am too bold: 'tis not to me she speaks.Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven, Having some business, do entreat her eyesTo twinkle in their spheres till they return.What if her **eyes** were there, they in her head? The brightness of her cheek **would** shame those stars,As daylight doth a lamp. Her **eyes** in heaven (20)Would through the airy region stream so brightThat birds **would** sing and think it were not night.See how she leans her cheek **upon** her hand O that I were a glove **upon** that hand,That I might touch that cheek! Juliet.Ay me!Romeo. She speaks. O, speak again, bright angel, for thou artAs glorious to this night, being o'er my head,As is a winged messenger of heaven (30)Unto the white-upturned wondering **eyes** Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him When he bestrides the lazy-puffing cloudsAnd sails **upon** the bosom of the air.Juliet.O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name;Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.Romeo.[Aside.] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?Juliet. 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy: (40)Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.What's Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot, Nor arm, nor face, nor any other partBelonging to a **man**. O, be some other name. What's in a name? That which we call a rose By any other name **would** smell as sweet;So Romeo **would**, were he not Romeo call'd, Retain that dear perfection which he owesWithout that title. Romeo, doff thy name, And for that name, which is no part of thee, (50)Take all myself.Romeo.I take thee at thy word.Call me but love, and I'll be new baptis'd; Henceforth I **never** will be Romeo.Juliet.What **man** art thou that, thus bescreened in night, So stumblest on my counsel?Romeo.By a nameI know not how to tell thee who I am:My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself, Because it is an enemy to thee. (60)Had I it written, I **would** tear the word. Juliet.My ears have yet not drunk a hundred wordsOf thy tongue's uttering, yet I know the sound.Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague? Romeo. Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike. Juliet.How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here. Romeo.With love's **light** wings did I o'erperch these walls, (70)For stony limits cannot hold love out,And what love can do, that dares love attempt: Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.Juliet.If they do see thee, they will murder thee. Romeo.Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye Than twenty of their swords. Look thou but sweetAnd I am proof against their enmity.Juliet.I **would** not for the **world** they saw thee here.Romeo. I have night's cloak to hide me from their **eyes**, And, but thou love me, let them find me here; (80)My **life** were better ended by their hateThan death prorogued, wanting of thy love.Juliet. By whose direction found'st thou out this place?Romeo.By love, that first did prompt me to enquire. He lent me counsel, and I lent him **eyes**. I am no pilot, yet, wert thou as far As that vast shore wash'd with the furthest sea,I should adventure for such merchandise.Juliet.Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face, Else **would** a maiden blush bepaint my cheek (90) For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.Fain **would** I dwell on form; fain, fain denyWhat I have spoke. But farewell compliment.Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay', And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear'st, Thou mayst prove false. At lovers' perjuries,They say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won, I'll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay, (100) So thou wilt woo: but else, not for the **world**.In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond;And therefore thou mayst think my 'haviour **light**:But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true Than those that have more cunning to be strange. I should have been more strange, I must confess,But that thou overheard'st, ere I was 'ware,My true-love passion: therefore pardon me;And not impute this yielding to **light** love Which the **dark** night hath so discovered. (110)Romeo.Lady, by yonder blessed moon I vow,That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops --Juliet.O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy love prove likewise variable. Romeo.What shall I swear by?Juliet. Do not swear at all.Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,Which is the god of my idolatry,And I'll believe thee. (120)Romeo.If my **heart**'s dear love --Juliet.Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night: It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too **like** the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere **one** can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night! This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest Come to thy **heart** as that within my breast! (130)Romeo.O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?Juliet.What satisfaction canst thou have to-night? Romeo.The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.Juliet.I gave thee mine before thou didst request it: And yet I **would** it were to give again. Romeo.Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?Juliet.But to be frank, and give it thee again. And yet I wish but for the thing I have: My bounty is as boundless as the sea, My love as deep; the more I give to thee, (140)The more I have, for both are infinite.Nurse calls within I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu! Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true. Stay but a little, I will come again. Exit, above. Romeo.O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard. Being in night, all this is but a dream, Too flattering-sweet to be substantial. Re-enter JULIET, above. Juliet.Three **words**, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, (150)By **one** that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what **time** thou wilt perform the rite;And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the **world**.Nurse.[Within] Madam! Juliet.I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,I do beseech thee-- Nurse.[Within] Madam! Juliet.By and by, I come:-- To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief: (160) To-morrow will I send. Romeo.So thrive my soul-- Juliet.A thousand times good night! Exit, above.Romeo.A thousand times the worse, to want thy **light**.Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.Retiring. Re-enter JULIET, above.Juliet.Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice, To lure this tassel-gentle back again! Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud; (170) Else **would** I tear the cave where Echo lies, And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine, With repetition of my Romeo's name. Romeo.It is my soul that calls **upon** my name:How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night, Like softest music to attending ears!Juliet.Romeo! Romeo.My dear? Juliet.At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee? (180) Romeo.At the hour of nine. Juliet.I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then. I have forgot why I did call thee back. Romeo.Let me stand here till thou remember it.Juliet.I shall forget, to have thee still stand there, Remembering how I love thy company. Romeo.And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget, Forgetting any other home but this. Juliet.'Tis almost morning; I **would** have thee gone: And yet no further than a wanton's bird; (190) Who lets it hop a little from her hand, Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves, And with a silk thread plucks it back again, So loving-jealous of his liberty. Romeo.I **would** I were thy bird. Juliet.Sweet, so **would** I: Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing. Good night, good night! parting is such sweet sorrow, That I shall say good night till it be morrow. (200) Exit above Romeo.Sleep dwell **upon** thine **eyes**, peace in thy breast! Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest! Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell, His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell. Exit Isn't that fantastic? I think it's as good as it gets. The overall tragic/comic/romantic plot was captivating as well, even though we all knew how it was going to end. My fault with the text, is with some of the other speeches. They kind of go on a bit, drift off on a tangent and get a bit complex with their punning. That wasn't so much fun for me. However, I have to bump this up from 3 stars to 4 stars, just for that **one** scene. Also, watch the Franco Zeffirelli film, I think it's the best interpretation there is. "

       "Ans so ends my summer with Homer, finally, after many short reading sessions spliced in between other (and easier) things to read. The trouble with that method is of course the obligatory re-reading of passages to try and pick up the forgotten thread. But I did it, with only the help of a small (and barely helpful) dictionary of mythology to guide me in my ignorance. I **could** have used a good-looking and enthusiastic classics scholar to point out the hidden wonders that I undoubtedly missed, but I did manage to pick out a few marvels:Ulysses obliterating the Cyclops -  Myself above them from a rising groundGuide the sharp stake, and twirl it round and round[...]In his broad eye he whirls the fiery wood;From the pierced pupil spouts the boinling blood;Singed are his brows; the scorching lids grow black;the jelly bubbles, and the fibres crack.And as when armourers temper in the fordThe keen-edged pole-axe, or the shining sword,The red-hot metal hisses in the lake,Thus in his eye-ball hiss'd the plunging stake.He sends a dreadful groan, the rocks aroundThrough all their inmost winding caves resound. [...]Yes, I just about felt that in my own eyeball!How about the horrible Scylla:Hideous her voice, and with less terrors roarThe whelps of lions in the midnight hour.Twelve feet, deform'd and foul, the fiend dispreads;Six horrid necks she rears, and six terrific heads;Her jaws grin dreadful with three rows of teeth;Jaggy they stant, the gaping den of death;Her parts obsene the raging billows hide;Her bosom terribly o'erlooks the tide. Aside from these fabulous monsters, I guess I enjoyed (and who wouldn't) Book XIII, Ulysses transformed into an old beggar, finally back in Ithaca, as well as the effusive family reunions in the later books. So, I'm very happy that I've finally read this. Next summer: The Iliad, which I should have started with but I **like** going backwards..."

       "It rained, but it was colder than what it should be to be raining. A combination of warmer atmosphere and colder temperatures on the ground produced an ice storm. It hit over the weekend so I **could** sit quite comfortably by my fireplace and watch out the window as the rain formed into sheets of ice on the streets and sidewalks. Power lines thickened as they became cubed in ice. Foot **long** and longer icicles dangled and swayed from the power lines, from the eaves of houses, from signs, from fence lines. The most affected though were the trees. The bigger the tree with the thicker branches, the more affected they **would** be. The ice accumulated on their branches bending and twisting them down to the ground. They became monsters, slumbering beneath an armour of ice. I’d been thinking about rereading Beowulf for some **time**. This story has been a part of me for almost as **long** as I can remember. I read a child’s version when I was young, several times before moving on to other more adult translations. The idea of a **man** taking on a monster, much stronger than most **men**, and finding a way to defeat him was compelling mythology for my young **mind**. The terror of it, the monster that comes into your home and kills in the dead of the night and takes heads as trophies, left shivers in the very center of me. Beowulf hears of a monster who is attacking the Danes. He is **one** of thirteen **men** who decide to go to the rescue of Hrothgar, King of the Danes. He goes because he needs to make a name for himself, as Buliwyf in the movie The 13th Warrior says: ” I have only these hands.” Beowulf is poor, renown for his strength, but he has no Hall to call his own and, but for this small band, no **men** to call him King.”Their mail-shirts glinted, hard and hand-linked; the high-gloss iron of their armour rang. So they duly arrived in their grim war-graith and gear at the hall, and, weary from the sea, stacked wide shields of the toughest hardwood against the wall, then collapsed on the benches; battle-dress and weapons clashed. They collected their spears in a seafarers’ stook, a stand of greyish tapering ash. And the troops were as good as their weapons.” I had spent most of the day finishing another book and, thus, had started reading Beowulf late in the evening. The wife and my Scottish Terrier had gone to bed, and I was left in the soft glow of my reading lamp. Most of the city had lost power as lines too heavy with ice had crashed down **one** by **one**. I had candles close to hand. It **never** crossed my **mind**, power or no power, that I **would** go to bed. Beowulf was written in Old English between 975-1025. The Seamus Heaney translation that I read had the Old English on **one** page and Heaney’s translation on the other page. In college, I took a Chaucer class and became a fair hand at deciphering Middle English, but looking and even pronouncing these unfamiliar **words** did not ring any ancient bells in my English soul. I **would** have had better luck reading Greek than Old English. \n",

       "As Beowulf grapples with Grendel and then with Grendel’s mother, I was just as enthralled with the story as I was as a wee tot. The carnage, the darkness, the uncertainty that Beowulf had to feel, despite his boasts to the contrary, all lend a fine, sharp edge to the tale. As I read, I also started to hear the sharp cracks and howls of ice heavy tree limbs separating from their trunk in much the same way as Beowulf pulls Grendel’s arm loose from his shoulder. The crash of these ice shrouded branches against the frozen ground sounded to my **mind** **like** the steel swords of the Geats banging against their metal wrapped shields. Curiosity got the better of me, and I walked out of my back door into an alien landscape. Each individual stem of grass had frozen into a nub of ice. With **every** step, my boots crunched and slipped across this icy topography. Piles of limbs laid at the bottoms of the bigger trees. A small limb detached from the cottonwood tree as I stood there and made discordant music as it hit the limbs below before finally landing among its fallen, dying brethren on the ground. The younger trees, more limber, were probably fine, I told myself. They are bowed over as if in supplication to Mother Nature. Their top branches were frozen to the ground, making arches of their shapes. It was all very beautiful. I remembered reading about a party that was given for Anastasia, the Russian princess, before her **life** became tangled in the turmoil of revolution. The servants were outside spraying water on the trees so they **would** glitter with ice as the aristocracy arrived on their horse pulled, bell laden sleighs. I went back inside and peeled off my boots and my jacket and returned to Beowulf. Another log was required for the fire, so I spent a few moments poking the remaining logs to make room for more wood. I flinched as I heard more crashes from outside. An assembly of Geats preparing for battle. When I finally settled back into my chair, Beowulf has become King of the Geats and fights battles with the greatest champions of the land. He involves himself in disagreements. ”When Eofor cleft the old Swede’s helmet, halved it open, he fell, death-pale: his feud-calloused hand **could** not stave off the fatal blow.”I just loved that…feud-calloused hand. I also really liked..”your blade making a mizzle of his blood.” There are lines **like** that all through the story. Words unfamiliar and evocative of a different age. Beowulf does age and does need the help of others in the end when he battles a dragon, but few **men** are made with the courage that he is, and they fail to help him when he needs it most. He does kill the dragon, but at the cost of his own **life**. \n",
       "No sword blade sent him to his death,My bare hands stilled his heartbeatsAnd wrecked the bone-house. Now blade and hand,Sword and sword-stroke, will assay the hoard.”\n",
       "Stormy weather requires the proper book and a proper, hot, Scottish tea laced with a few drops of Scotch whiskey. For me Beowulf, those 3,182 lines, added enchantment and necromancy to a **world** transforming before my **eyes** into something magical and unknown.If you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visit http://www.jeffreykeeten.comI also have a Facebook blogger page at:https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeeten"

Words can be **like** X-rays, if you use the properly—they'll go through anything. You read and your pierced.This book is piercing. You will feel it in the guts of your soul and the deepest recesses of your subconscious.Do you question the foundation of civilization? If so, this book is for you.Not sure why it took me more than three decades to read this book, and in the past three months, three separate nonfiction books I read have referenced Brave New World,  Deep Work (5⭐️s), The Future of the Mind (3⭐️s), and How to Change Your Mind (5⭐️s). Surprisingly, I liked Brave New World more than Huxley's The Doors of Perception (3⭐️s), as it was more cogent. From the get go there is plenty to unpack, launching the second paragraph into the finals for most intriguing intro paragraph **ever**:The enormous room on the ground floor faced towards the north. Cold for all the summer beyond the panes, for all the tropical heat of the room itself, a harsh thin **light** glared through the windows, hungrily seeking some draped lay figure, some pallid shape of academic goose-flesh, but finding only the glass and nickel and bleakly shining porcelain of a laboratory. Wintriness responded to wintriness. The overalls of the workers were white, their hands gloved with a pale corpse-coloured rubber. The **light** was frozen, dead, a ghost. Only from the yellow barrels of the microscopes did it borrow a certain rich and living substance, lying along the polished tubes **like** butter, streak after luscious streak in **long** recession down the work tables.Still thinking about this **one**, might be a contender for future review. The writing is stunning and cerebral, at times evoking a familiar nostalgia.Impulse arrested spills over, and the flood is feeling, the flood is passion, the flood is even madness: it depends on the force of the current, the height and strength of the barrier. The unchecked stream flows smoothly down its appointed channels into a calm well being.\"Well…\" The Savage hesitated. He **would** have liked to say something about solitude, about night, about the mesa lying pale under the moon, about the precipice, the plunge into shadowy darkness, about death. He **would** have liked to speak; but there were no **words**. Not even in Shakespeare.... the flower of the present rosily blossomed ..."

       "It's impossible to review a translation when you don't speak the original language, so what am I to write? So instead here are some choice parts compared between the translations I have - Fagles (1996), Palmer (1884), now the new **one** from Wilson (2017), and for fun, the German translation from Voß (1781).The beginning:Fagles:Sing to me of the **man**, Muse, the **man** of twists and turnsdriven **time** and again off course, once he had plunderedthe hallowed heights of Troy.Many cities of **men** he saw and learned their minds,many pains he suffered, heartsick on the open sea,fighting to save his **life** and bring his comrades home.Palmer:Tell of the storm-tossed **man**, O Muse, who wandered **long** after he sacked the sacred citadel of Troy. Many the **men** whose towns he saw, whose ways he proved; and many a pang he bore in his own breast at sea, while struggling for his **life** and his **men**’s safe return.Wilson:Tell me about a complicated **man**.Muse, tell me how he wandered and was lostwhen he had wrecked the holy town of Troy,and where he went, and who he met, the painhe suffered in the storms at sea, and howhe worked to save his **life** and bring his menback home.Voß:Sage mir, Muse, die Taten des vielgewanderten Mannes,Welcher so weit geirrt nach der heiligen Troja Zerstörung,Vieler Menschen Städte gesehn und Sitte gelernt hatUnd auf dem Meere so viel unnennbare Leiden erduldet,Seine Seele zu retten und seiner Freunde Zurückkunft.Compare that - especially Wilson's choice of 'complicated' instead of 'storm-tossed' or 'of twists and turns' or 'vielgewandert' (well-traveled?) is interesting, that's **one** of the choices most media reviews focus on - --------------------------------------The death of Antinous:Fagles:With that he trained a stabbing arrow on Antinous . . .     just lifting a gorgeous golden loving-cup in his hands,  just tilting the two-handled goblet back to his lips,     about to drain the wine —and slaughter the last thing     on the suitor’s **mind**: who **could** dream that **one** foe     in that crowd of feasters, however great his power,     **would** bring down death on himself, and black doom?     But Odysseus aimed and shot Antinous square in the throat     and the point went stabbing clean through the soft neck and out —     and off to the side he pitched, the cup dropped from his grasp     as the shaft sank home, and the **man**’s **life**-blood came spurtingfrom his nostrils —                         thick red jets —                                          a sudden thrust of his foot —     he kicked away the table — food showered across the floor,     the bread and meats soaked in a swirl of bloody filth.Palmer:He spoke, and aimed a pointed arrow at Antinouäs. The **man** was in the act to raise his goodly goblet,—gold it was and double-eared, —and even now guided it in his hands to drink the wine. Death gave his **heart** no notice. For who **could** think that in this company of feasters **one** of the crowd, however strong, **could** bring **upon** him cruel death and dismal doom? But Odysseus aimed an arrow and hit him in the throat; right through his tender neck the sharp point passed. He sank down sideways; from his hand the goblet fell when he was hit, and at once from his nose ran a thick stream of human blood. Roughly he pushed his table back, kicking it with his foot, and scattered off the food **upon** the floor. The bread and roasted meat were thrown away.Wilson:He aimedhis deadly arrow at Antinous.The young **man** sat there, just about to lifthis golden goblet, swirling wine around, ready to drink. He had no thought of death.How **could** he? Who **would** think a single **man**,among so many banqueters, **would** dareto risk **dark** death, however strong he was?Odysseus aimed at his throat, then shot.The point pierced all the way through his soft neck.He flopped down to the side and his cup slippedout of his hand, and then thick streams of bloodgushed from his nostrils. His foot twitched and knockedthe table down; food scattered on the ground. The bread and roasted meat were soiled with blood.Voß:Sprach’s, und Antinoos traf er mit bitterm Todesgeschosse.Dieser wollte vom Tisch das zweigehenkelte schöneGoldne Geschirr aufheben und faßt’ es schon mit den Händen,Daß er tränke des Weins; allein von seiner ErmordungAhndet’ ihm nichts: und wer in der schmausenden Männer GesellschaftHätte geglaubt, daß einer, und wenn er der Tapferste wäre,Unter so vielen es wagte, ihm Mord und Tod zu bereiten!Aber Odysseus traf mit dem Pfeil ihn grad in die Gurgel,Daß im zarten Genick die Spitze wieder hervordrang.Und er sank zur Seite hinab; der Becher voll WeinesStürzte dahin aus der Hand des Erschossenen, und aus der NaseSprang ihm ein Strahl dickströmenden Bluts. Er wälzte sich zuckend,Stieß mit dem Fuß an den Tisch, und die Speisen fielen zur Erde;Brot und gebratenes Fleisch ward blutig.----------------------------------Or lastly, the killing of the slave girls:Fagles:\"No clean death for the likes of them, by god! Not from me —they showered abuse on my head,     my mother’s too!  You sluts —the suitors’ whores!”        With that, taking a cable used on a **dark**-prowed ship     he coiled it over the roundhouse, lashed it fast to a tall column,     hoisting it up so high no toes **could** touch the ground.     Then, as doves or thrushes beating their spread wings     against some snare rigged up in thickets —flying in     for a cozy nest but a grisly bed receives them —     so the women’s heads were trapped in a line,     nooses yanking their necks up, **one** by **one**     so all might die a pitiful, ghastly death . . .     they kicked up heels for a little —not for **long**.Palmer:“By no honorable death **would** I take away the lives of those who poured reproaches on my head and on my mother and were the suitors’ comrades.”He spoke, and tied the cable of a **dark**-bowed ship to a great pillar, then lashed it to the round-house, stretching it high across, too high for **one** to touch the feet **upon** the ground. And as the wide-winged thrushes or the doves strike on a net set in the bushes; and when they think to go to roost a cruel bed receives them; even so the women held their heads in line, and around **every** neck a noose was laid, that they might die most vilely. They twitched their feet a little, but not **long**.Wilson:“I refuse to grant these girlsa clean death, since they poured down shame on meand Mother, when they lay beside the suitors.”At that, he wound a piece of sailor’s roperound the rotunda and round the mighty pillar,stretched up so high no foot **could** touch the ground.As doves or thrushes spread their wings to flyhome to their nests, but someone sets a trap—they crash into a net, a bitter bedtime;    just so the girls, their heads all in a row,were strung up with the noose around their necksto make their death an agony. They gasped,feet twitching for a while, but not for longVoß:Wahrlich, den reinen Tod des Schwertes sollen die WeiberMir nicht sterben, die mich und meine Mutter so langeSchmäheten und mit den Freiern so schändliche Greuel verübten!Sprach’s, da band er ein Seil des blaugeschnäbelten SchiffesAn den ragenden Pfeiler und knüpft’ es hoch am GewölbeFest, daß die Hangenden nicht mit den Füßen die Erde berührten.Interesting that only Fagles has Odysseus directly speak to the women and call them 'sluts' - neither Palmer nor Wilson even have that sentence. Voß misses two or three sentences all the other translators have.It's amazing how different these translations are, not just in choice of **words**, but even in content. Next I guess I have to learn ancient Greek?\n",

       "Quite a good piece of literature, but nothing compared to the Grapes of Wrath. Also felt **like** it was a little **long**, and passages of gold were rarer. Favourite quotes:\"Tom slowly folded the telegram and folded it again and again until it was a square no longer than his thumb. He walked to the house, through the kitchen, through the little living room, and into his bedroom. He took his **dark** suit out of the clothespress and laid it over the back of a chair, and he put a white shirt and a black tie on the seat of the chair. And then he lay down on the bed and turned his face to the wall.\"\"He took no rest, no recreation, and he became rich without pleasure and respected without friends.\"“Sometimes a kind of glory lights up the **mind** of a **man**. It happens to nearly everyone. You can feel it growing or preparing **like** a fuse burning toward dynamite. It is a feeling in the stomach, a delight of the nerves, of the forearms. The skin tastes the air, and **every** deep-drawn breath is sweet. Its beginning has the pleasure of a great stretching yawn; it flashes in the brain and the whole **world** glows outside your **eyes**. A **man** may have lived all of his **life** in the gray, and the land and trees of him **dark** and somber. The events, even the important ones, may have trooped by faceless and pale. And then -the glory- so that a cricket song sweetens his ears, the smell of the earth rises chanting to his nose, and dappling **light** under a tree blesses his **eyes**. Then a **man** pours outward, a torrent of him, and yet he is not diminished. And I guess a **man**'s importance in the **world** can be measured by the quality and number of his glories. It is a lonely thing but it relates us to the **world**. It is the mother of all creativeness, and it sets each **man** separate from all other **men**. ”AND THIS:\"Our species is the only creative species, and it has only **one** creative instrument, the individual **mind** and spirit of a **man**. Nothing was **ever** created by two **men**. There are no good collaborations, whether in art, in music, in poetry, in mathematics, in philosophy. Once the miracle of creation has taken place, the group can build and extend it, but the group **never** invents anything. The preciousness lies in the lonely **mind** of a **man**. And now the forces marshaled around the concept of the group have declared a war of extermination on that preciousness, the **mind** of **man**. By disparagement, by starvation, by repressions, forced direction, and the stunning blows of conditioning, the free, roving **mind** is being pursued, roped, blunted, drugged. It is a sad suicidal course our species seems to have taken.And this I believe: that the free, exploring **mind** of the individual human is the most valuable thing in the **world**. And this I **would** fight for: the freedom of the **mind** to take any direction it wishes, undirected. And this I must fight against: any religion, or government which limits or destroys the individual. This is what I am and what I am about. I can understand why a system built on a pattern must try to destroy the free **mind**, for it is the **one** thing which can by inspection destroy such a system. Surely I can understand this, and I hate it and I will fight against it to preserve the **one** thing that separates us from the uncreative beasts. If the glory can be killed, we are lost.\" "

There are passages in this novel that soar. The scales will fall from your **eyes** and you will see that this brick of a book, that you perhaps have always thought of as a chore, waiting, sitting heavily, at the bottom of your to-do list, is actually laden with dense and unimaginably **dark** imagery.I offer by way of example a few simple passages I have lovingly marked with dogeared pages:From Chapter 57:\"In bony, ribby regions of the earth, where at the base of high broken cliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings **upon** the plain, you will often discover images as of the petrified forms of the Leviathan partly merged in grass, which of a windy day breaks against them in a surf of green surges....Nor when expandingly lifted by your subject, can you fail to trace out great whales in the starry heavens, and boats in pursuit of them: as when **long** filled with thoughts of war the Eastern nations saw armies locked in battle among the clouds. Thus at the North have I chased Leviathan round and round the Pole with the revolutions of the bright points that first defined him to me. And beneath the effulgent Anarctic skies I have boarded the Argo-Navis, and joined the chase against the starry Cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of Hyrdrus and the Flying Fish.With a frigate's anchors for my bridle-bitts and fasces of harpoons for spurs, **would** I **could** mount that whale and leap the topmost skies, to see whether the fabled heavens with all their countless tents really lie encamped beyond my mortal sight!\"Please savor for a moment...okay, now this...From Chapter 96:\"There is wisdom that is woe; but there is a woe that is madness. And there is a Catskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the blackest gorges, and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces. And even if he for **ever** flies within the gorge, that gorge is in the mountains; so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle is still higher than other birds **upon** the plain, even though they soar.\"From Chapter 37:Ahab: \"I leave a white and turbid wake; pale waters, paler cheeks, where'er I sail. The envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track; let them; but first I pass.Yonder, by the **ever**-brimming goblet's rim, the warm waves blush **like** wine. The gold brow plumbs the blue. The diver sun -- slow dived from noon, -- goes down; my soul mounts up! she wearies with her endless hill. Is, then, the crown too heavy that I wear? this Iron Crown of Lombardy. Yet it is bright with many a gem; I, the wearer, see not its far flashing; but darkly feel that I wear that, that dazzingly confounds. 'Tis iron -- that I know -- not gold. 'Tis split, too -- that I feel; the jagged edge galls me so, my brain seems to beat against the solid metal; aye, steel skull, mine; the sort that needs no helmet in the most brain-battering fight!Dry heat **upon** my brow? Oh! **time** was, when as the sunrise nobly spurred me, so the sunset soothed. No more. This lovely **light**, it lights not me; all loveliness is anguish to me, since I can ne'er enjoy. Gifted with the high perception, I lack the low, enjoying power; damned, most subtly and most malignantly! damned in the midst of Paradise! Good night -- good night!\"If that's not enough to convince you to read this book (I'd hope it were) there's also some terribly **dark** stuff in here that I think a lot of people make the mistake of assuming **could** not have been imagined back in the middle of the 19th century. The crew of the Pequod attempts to invoke the power of an old sailor's charm by hanging the heads of a sperm whale and a right whale to opposite sides of the ship; while stripping a whale's carcass of its blubber, a sailor slips from the deck and completely disappears within the cavernous flesh of the festering whale; in a woozy hallucinatory scene the narrator walks through a native temple erected within the hulking skeleton of a beached whale overgrown with tropical greenery.If that's still not enough still, the book is filled with proto-Joycean narrative wrinkles. About half way through the book I was no longer sure who was narrating the obsessive passages about the biology of the variety of whale species - despite the fact that everyone knows from the famous opening lines of Moby Dick that Ishmael is supposed to be the narrator. But Ishmael is repeatedly called out in the third person as lacking the encyclopedic knowledge necessary to elaborate on many of the scientific topics discussed throughout some of the denser portions of the book. In addition, the Pequod's crew members frequently sidle off and engage in extended Shakespearean monologues (see excerpt from Chapter 37, above), as part of the introduction a particularly Nabokovian Sub-Sub-Librarian (think Kinbote/John Ray Jr. Phd.) provides a laundry list of literary allusions to the Leviathan spanning across the course of the history of Western Literature, the unnamed (not Ishmael) narrator provides his own original attempt at a complete taxonomy of the varying sub-species of whales.A lot of the discussion surrounding this book involves discerning what it means - is it a parable of madness, or revenge, the pursuit of the American dream?Read this book, not to find out what it means, and not to cross it off of your list, but because it is painfully beautiful."

One star:\"Of Peleus' son, Achilles, sing, O Muse,The vengeance, deep and deadly; whence to GreeceUnnumbered ills arose; which many a soulOf mighty warriors to the viewless shades\"--------------------------------------Alexander Pope (1715)That's probably the most beautiful poem I've **ever** read, but it has little to do with the original. As Richard Bentley wrote: \"It is a pretty poem, Mr. Pope, but you must not call it Homer.\"4 Stars:\"Achilles' wrath, to Greece the direful springOf woes unnumber'd, heavenly goddess, sing!That wrath which hurl'd to Pluto's gloomy reignThe souls of mighty chiefs untimely slain;\"--------------------------------------Samuel Butler (1898)Well balanced and accessible Best prose translation of the Iliad in my opinion. 5 stars:\"Sing, O goddess, the anger of Achilles son of Peleus, that brought countless ills **upon** the Achaeans.Many a brave soul did it send hurrying down to Hades, and many a hero did it yield a prey to dogs and vultures, for so were the counsels of Jove fulfilled from the day on which the son of Atreus, king of **men**, and great Achilles, first fell out with **one** another.\"[...]\"As he spoke he drew his knife across the throats of the victims,and laid them down gasping and dying **upon** the ground, for the knife had reft them oftheir strength. Then they poured wine from the mixing-bowl into the cups, and prayedto the everlasting gods, saying, Trojans and Achaeans among **one** another, “Jove, mostgreat and glorious, and ye other everlasting gods, grant that the brains of them whoshall first sin against their oaths- of them and their children- may be shed **upon** theground even as this wine, and let their wives become the slaves of strangers.”"

       "Alright, so I think this might be the most beautiful book I have **ever** read. Each segment, each sentence, each word is quotable. If you were to note down some special moments from the book, you had write the book as it is. Such is the power the book possesses; it enchants you to the highest degree with its content, with its fluid divinity and its phenomenal poetic aura. At no point does it stop being divine. As rightly said in the epigraph for Kahlil Gibran: \"His power came from some great reservoir of spiritual **life** else it **could** not have been so universal and potent, but the majesty and beauty of the language with which he clothed it were all his own.\"I am so impressed and am in such immense awe that if I were to choose my religious/spiritual text, this **would** be it. If I were to carry **one** book all the **time** with me (**like** Gita, Bible or Koran), this **would** be it. For I have **never** come across any aphorisms or any sermons in such rich poetic texture. And it is so refreshing when you find out that the book carries a sense of pragmatism all along in its teachings. Yes, it has its own sense of romanticism and morality but no where does it digress to make **one** lose interest out of lack of practicality. Let me quote some lines here:And a woman who held a babe against her bosom said, Speak to us of childrenAnd he said: Your children are not your children.These are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.They come through you but not from you,And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.You may give them your love but not your thoughtsFor they have their own thoughts.You may house their bodies but not their soulsFor their souls dwell in the house of tomorrowwhich you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.You may strive to be **like** them,but seek not to make them **like** you.For **life** goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.You are the bows from which your childrenas living arrows are sent forth.The archer sees the mark **upon** the path of the infinite,and He bends you with His mightthat His arrows may go swift and far.Let your bending in the archer's hand be for gladness;For even as He loves the arrow that flies,so He loves also the bow that is stable. On clothes:Your clothes conceal much of your beauty, yet they hide not the unbeautiful.And though you seek in garments the freedom of privacy you may find in them a harness and a chain.Would that you **could** meet the sun and the wind with more of your skin and less of your raiment,For the breath of **life** is in the sunlight and the hand of **life** is in the wind.On reason and passion:Your reason and your passion are the rudder and the sails of your seafaring soul. If either your sails or your rudder be broken, you can but toss and drift, or else be held at a standstill in mid-seas.For reason, ruling alone, is a force confining; and passion, unattended, is a flame that burns to its own destruction.Therefore let your soul exalt your reason to the height of passion, that it may sing;And let it direct your passion with reason, that your passion may live through its own daily resurrection, and **like** the phoenix rise above its own ashes.On Joy and Sorrow:The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain.Is not the cup that holds your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter's oven?And is not the lute that soothes your spirit, the very wood that was hollowed with knives? In the last chapter: If this be vague **words**, then seek not to clear them. Vague and nebulous is the beginning of all things, but not their end, And I fain **would** have you remember me as a beginning. Life, and all that lives, is conceived in the mist and not in the crystal. And who knows but a crystal is mist in decay? And as you can see, I am going all gaga over the poetry in the book. So let me quote some lines that express it the most:Fain **would** I take with me all that is here. But how shall I?A voice cannot carry the tongue and the lips that gave it wings. Alone must it seek the ether.And alone and without his nest shall the eagle fly across the sun. At night the watchmen of the city say, 'Beauty shall rise with the dawn from the east.'And at noontide the toilers and the wayfarers say, ' We have seen her leaning over the earth from the windows of the sunset.Some of you say, \"Joy is greater than sorrow,\" and others say, \"Nay, sorrow is the greater.\"But I say unto you, they are inseparable.Together they come, and when **one** sits, alone with you at your board, remember that the other is asleep **upon** your bed. Build of your imaginings a bower in the wilderness ere you build a house within the city walls.For even as you have home-comings in your twilight, so has the wanderer in you, the **ever** distant and alone.Your house is your larger body.It grows in the sun and sleeps in the stillness of the night; and it is not dreamless. Does not your house dream? and dreaming, leave the city for grove or hill-top?And you, vast sea, sleeping mother,Who alone are peace and freedom to the river and the stream,Only another winding will this stream make, only another murmur in this gladeAnd then I shall come to you, a boundless drop to a boundless ocean.We wanderers, **ever** seeking the lonelier way, begin no day where we have ended another, and no sunrise finds us where left by sunset. Even while the earth sleeps we travel. We are the seeds of that tenacious plant, and it is in our ripeness and our fullness of **heart** that we are given to the wind to be scattered.Surely there is no greater gift to a **man** than that which turns all his aims into parching lips and all **life** into a fountain.And in this lies my honor and my reward-That whenever I come to the fountain to drink I find the living water itself thirsty; And it drinks me while I drink it. So much to be re-read again and again not only to just gain more out of them because the nectar I truly feel is overflowing in these verses but also to appreciate the sheer beauty and divinity of them. This book thus I suppose should be read by everyone. EVERYONE!"

We penetrated deeper and deeper into the **heart** of darkness.”Darkness in the novel isn’t just the darkness of night and of animal instincts but it slowly becomes a symbol of the human nature itself. “The vision seemed to enter the house with me—the stretcher, the phantom-bearers, the wild crowd of obedient worshippers, the gloom of the forests, the glitter of the reach between the murky bends, the beat of the drum, regular and muffled **like** the beating of a **heart**—the **heart** of a conquering darkness. It was a moment of triumph for the wilderness, an invading and vengeful rush which, it seemed to me, I **would** have to keep back alone for the salvation of another soul.”Peel a pelt of civilizing gloss off a **man** and the darkness of **heart** will be revealed.

In my counter-factual universe I see William Shakespeare as a Lieutenant at the First Somme. Imagine the war poetry that Shakespeare **could** have written. Perhaps **one** such war sonnet **would** have gone something **like** this: My subaltern’s **eyes** will ne’er again see the sun,Exposed hearts are more red than whores lips are red; If we go o’er the top we are sure to face the gun; And those caught on wires are things better off dead.I have seen bodies gouged open, red and white,And from froth-corrupted lungs seen gas leak;The scent of naturally rotting flesh gives more delightThan the breath of vesicant that from blisters reeks.I loathe the whine of 5-9s we needs all must knowDying screams hath a far more pleasing sound;I grant I ne’er saw an unworthy boy go;My subaltern when he dies rots on the ground. And yet, by heaven, I think my loss as rare As all the missing and dead I blench to compare. There is a scene in Act IV, rarely presented on-stage, wherein Hamlet looks **upon** Young Fortinbras' forces and feels guilt over his own concerns compared with the concerns of the **men** who go to die: \"...to my shame I see / The immanent death of twenty thousand **men** / That for a fantasy and a trick of fame / Go to their graves **like** beds...\" (IV.iv.59-62). Dulce Et Decorum Est Pro Patria Mori, indeed. "

On the other hand,away back in the dim distance, under the flickering **light** of the north star, behind some craggy hill or snow-covered mountain, stood a doubtful freedom - half frozen - beckoning us to come and share its hospitality.\" (123)It's worth a second look and you haven't read it before, you really ought to. There's a lot more here than \"slavery is bad\". Douglass' interpretation of religious identification among slave-holders will be of special interest to students of Southern literature."

And coroners must fill in the certificate- died of malnutrition- because the food must rot, must be forced to rot.

       "This is a harrowing tale of social injustice and the manipulation of resources by a handful of depraved, ungodly mortals. What follows is sheer misery and devastation—the earth reeks of corruption and its treasures are plundered. A land which is gloomy when the sun sets forth on the horizon, a land which is melancholic in the twinkling stars of the night. God's mercy has forsaken this despondent land—an earth that is empty of womb, barren. As despondency is an aftermath of grave misfortunes, so are misfortunes an aftermath of avarice—for **man** himself and the society as a whole. God's mercy is fleeting, away from the godforsaken land and slowly, but surely, seeps in the bleeding hearts of the people who have been wronged, who have been robbed of their very own souls—their once uncorrupted land.The Grapes of Wrath is a song of despair—a tale so melancholic that it tears your **heart** asunder. An apathetic and callous **heart** **would** have failed to produce such a poignant work. John felt deeply anguished over the grave injustice; he felt the misery of the displaced people as his own, and he felt their sorrow as his own. He felt something even more appalling than all of this: he witnessed the dismemberment of the family structure as a unit of these hapless people. He heard their sighs, he saw little kids dying of starvation, he heard the wailing mothers, and he witnessed the gravest tragedy of the human soul: honorable **men**, hardworking **men**—most importantly,MEN—stripped clean of their pride, for a single loaf of bread! I implore you to read the following excerpt from the novel in its entirety:\n",
       "Now, what'll you give for the team and wagon? Those fine bays, matched they are, matched in color, matched the way they walk, stride to stride. In the stiff pull—straining hams and buttocks, split second timed together. And in the morning, the **light** on them, bay **light**. They look over the fence sniffing for us, and the stiff ears swivel to hear us, and the black forelocks! I've got a girl. She likes to braid the manes and forelocks, puts little red bows on them. Likes to do it. Not any more. I **could** tell you a funny story about that girl and that off bay. Would make you laugh. Off horse is eight, near is ten, but might of been twin colts the way they work together. See? The teeth. Sound all over. Deep lungs. Feet fair and clean. How much? Ten dollars? For both? And the wagon—Oh, Jesus Christ! I'd shoot 'em for dog feed first. Oh, take 'em! Take 'em quick, mister.You're buying a little girl plaiting the forelocks, taking off her hair ribbon to make bows, standing back, head cocked, rubbing the soft noses with her cheek. You're buying years of work, toil in the sun; you're buying a sorrow that can't talk. But watch it, mister. There's a premium goes with this pile of junk and the bay horses—so beautiful—a packet of bitterness to grow in your house and to flower, some day. We **could** have saved you, but you cut us down, and soon you will be cut down and there'll be none of us to save you.\n",
       "John's deep dislike of the changing norms is apparent from the outset of the novel. He saw the looming shadows of greed and he sensed a change in the air. He might have been skeptical of the dramatic transformation at first, and perhaps later, even loathed the phenomena of industrialization and commercialization that were to plague his entire country, thereby taking everything into its clutches.

       "This is a powerful and poetic novel. I'm not sure it belongs in a category. It really seems incomparable to anything I've read before. There were some difficult things. For **one**, I don't think the sense of place was well established, which is insane when you think that it's often described as a novel about a place (Africa). I know it's Africa, but where in Africa? This was not established. I know the author is Nigerian, so I assumed it was in Nigeria, but this wasn't clear to me in the reading. Perhaps there's a reason for that and it was missed on me. This was my first reading, so I may have completely missed the obvious and need a re-reading. Besides that minor critique, Things Fall Apart is a beautiful story written by a masterful poet. Achebe's voice is not only unique, but it's beautifully raw and alive. There were two passages that nearly jumped off the page. One of them was the description of locusts descending. Sometimes writers are forced to write about experiences that are foreign to them. Sometimes their accounts succeed, sometimes they don't. When Okonkwo's village is attacked by locusts, it's very clear that Achebe knows first hand what this feels and looks **like**: \"At first, a fairly small swarm came. They were the harbingers sent to survey the land. And then appeared on the horizon a slowly-moving mass **like** a boundless sheet of black cloud drifting towards Umuofia. Soon it covered half the sky, and the solid mass was now broken by tiny **eyes** of **light** **like** the shining star dust. It was a tremendous sight, full of power and beauty.\"This is a short sample passage, but to me the entire description was breathtaking. I recommend this novel for that alone. It's also breathtaking to go back and read this passage and realize that it's a metaphor for what's to come. Achebe also knows what it's **like** to have a first rain after a dry season: \"At last the rain came. It was sudden and tremendous. For two or three moons the sun had been gathering strength till it seemed to breathe a breath of fire on the earth. All the grass had **long** been scorched brown, and the sands felt **like** live coals to the feet. Evergreen trees wore a dusty coat of brown. The birds were silenced in the forests, and the **world** lay panting under the live, vibrating heat. And then came the clap of thunder. It was an angry, metallic and thirsty clap, unlike the deep liquid rumbling of the rainy season. A mighty wind arose and filled the air with dust. Palm trees swayed as the wind combed their leaves into flying crests **like** strange and fantastic coiffure.\" This passage is so alive and real that it **could** only be described by a master poet that experienced it first hand. Things Fall Apart is important, but not only as a novel of African experience, but also as a work of art."

As soon as he saw Odysseus standing there, he dropped his ears and wagged his tail, but he **could** not get close up to his master. When Odysseus saw the dog on the other side of the yard, dashed a tear from his **eyes** without Eumaeus seeing it, and said: \"Eumaeus, what a noble hound that is over yonder on the manure heap: his build is splendid; is he as fine a fellow as he looks, or is he only **one** of those dogs that come begging about a table, and are kept merely for show?\" \"This hound,\" answered Eumaeus, \"belonged to him who has died in a far country. If he were what he was when Odysseus left for Troy, he **would** soon show you what he **could** do. There was not a wild beast in the forest that **could** get away from him when he was once on its tracks. But now he has fallen on evil times, for his master is dead and gone, and the women take no care of him.

We happen to know about it.”Gandalf flung open the door, blocked out its space for a moment with his thick body, and hurried into the room.“Frodo!” He put out his broad, flat hand with well-concealed excitement. “I’m glad to see you, my friend. . . .Samwise. . . .”“Makes us full of pain, he does,” cried Gollum.As Gandalf left the room again Gollum got up and went over to Master Frodo and pulled his hand down, kissing him on the Ring.“You knows I love you,” he babbled.“You forget there’s a lord present,” said Faramir.Gollum looked around suspiciously.“You kiss the fat **one** too.”“What a low, vulgar beast!”“I don’t care!” cried Gollum, and began to clog on the stone mantle. Then he remembered the rope and couched guiltily on the stones just as a tall warrior led Meriadoc into the room.“Bles-sed pre-cious,” Gollum crooned, holding out his arms to Master Frodo. “Come to your own **one** that loves you.”Meriadoc, relinquished by the **long** haired Warrior, rushed across the room and kicked Gollum savagely to the ground.“The bles-sed pre-cious! Dids I do something to deserve these nasty hobbitses? Stand back. Let me be. Let poor Smeagol be.”Mr. Frodo and I in turn leaned down and took Gollum's small, reluctant hand. Afterward we kept looking at Meriadoc with surprise. I don’t think we had **ever** really believed him so cruel before....\"*freely adapted from Chapter VII of Fitzgerald's book, with a surprising minimum of alterations"

Let it come in. We **think** we don't deserve love, we **think** if we let it in we'll become too soft. But a wise man named Levine **said** it right. He **said**, \"Love is the only rational act.\"Sometimes you cannot believe what you **see**, you have to believe what you feel.

Listening with a quiet heart and a waiting soul, open soul, without passion, without desire, without judgment and without opinion.A the end , don't Let Anyone Else Tell You What Your Life Means . You Can Create Your Own Purpose For Your Life ! With purpose we find meaning in what we do ...Art by Ashley Mackenzie "

Does he collect butterflies?' They ask: 'How old is he?' 'How many brothers does he have?' 'How much does he weigh?' 'How much money does his father **make**?' Only then do they **think** they **know** him.\"\"The proof of the little prince's existence is that he was delightful, that he laughed, and that he wanted a sheep. When someone wants a sheep, that proves he exists.\"\"If I try to describe him here, it's so I won't forget him. It's sad to forget a friend. Not everyone has had a friend.\"\"In those days, I didn't understand anything. I should have judged her according to her actions, not her words. She perfumed my planet and lit up my life. I should **never** have run away! i ought to have realized the tenderness underlying her silly pretensions. Flowers are so contradictory! But I was too young to **know** how to love her.\"\"'Of course I love you,' the flower told him. 'It was my fault you **never** knew. It doesn't matter. But you were just as silly as I was. Try to be happy...'\"\"Don't hang around **like** this; it's irritating. You made up your mind to leave. Now go.\"\"'Then you shall pass judgement on yourself,' the king answered. 'That is the hardest **thing** of all. It is much harder to judge yourself than to judge others. If you truly succeed in juding yourself, it's because you are truly a wise man.'\"\"'That's right,' the fox **said**. 'For me you're only a little boy just **like** a hundred thousand other little boys. And I have no need of you. And you have no need of me, either. For you I'm only a fox **like** a hundred thousand other foxes. But if you tame me, we'll need each other. You'll be the only boy in the **world** for me. I'll be the only fox in the **world** for you...'\"\"'For instance, if you come at four in the afternoon, I'll begin to be happy by three. The closer it gets to four, the happier I'll feel. By four I'll be all excited and worried; I'll discover what it costs to be happy! But if you come at any old time, I'll **never** **know** when I should prepare my heart...'\"\"'You're lovely, but you're empty,' he went on. 'One couldn't die for you.'\"\"'Here is my secret. It;s quite simple: One sees clearly only with the heart. Anything essential is invisible to the eyes.'\"\"It's **good** to have had a friend, **even** if you're going to die.\"\"But eyes are blind. You have to look with the heart.\"\"But I wasn't reassured. I remembered the fox. You risk tears if you let yourself be tamed.\"\"And when you're consoled (everyone eventually is consoled), you'll be glad you've known me. You'll always be my friend. You'll feel **like** laughing with me. You'll open your window sometimes just for the fun of it...And your friends will be amazed to **see** you laughing while you're looking up at the sky.\""

If, on the other hand, she had made everything up, I am sure she **would** have seen to it that such elementary issues as the number of boys present were consistent.\"\"But do you really mean, sir,\" **said** Peter, \"that extremely important **people** at the top of the political establishment **could** have committed serious crimes in their past, and no **one** knows about it?\"\"Nothing is more probable,\" **said** the Professor, taking off his spectacles and beginning to polish them, while he muttered to himself, \"I wonder what they do teach them at these schools.\" \"But what are we to do?\" **said** Susan.

But she was not wanted to speak. It was enough for her to feel.One half of the **world** cannot understand the pleasures of the other.Anything interests between those who love; and anything will serve as introduction to what is near the heart.There are **people**, who the more you do for them, the less they will do for themselves.But a sanguine temper, though for ever expecting more **good** than occurs, does not always pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression. It soon flies over the present failure, and begins to hope again.It is a great deal more natural than **one** **could** wish, that a young man, brought up by those who are proud, luxurious, and selfish, should be proud, luxurious, and selfish too.It is very unfair to judge of anybody's conduct without an intimate knowledge of their situation.There is **one** **thing**, Emma, which a man can always do, if he chooses, and that is, his duty; not by maneuvering and finessing, but by vigour and resolution.It was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted spirits.Something occurred while they were at Hartfield to **make** Emma **want** their advice; and, which was still more lucky, she wanted exactly the advice they gave.I **never** **could** have supposed it. But I love out of the **world**, and am often astonished at what I bear.Why did we wait for anything? Why not seize the pleasure at once? How often is happiness destroyed by preparation, foolish preparation?I am quite enough in love. I should be sorry to be more.For they **say** everyone is in love once in their lives, and I shall have been let off easily.There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart.I condition for nothing else; but, without music, life **would** be a blank to me.A vast deal may be done by those who dare to act.Seldom, very seldom does complete truth belong to any human disclosure; seldom can it happen that **something** is not a little disguised, or a little mistaken."

I had always thought that someday you'd **make** **something** interesting but, I **never** thought it was going to be such a disturbing experiment.I've been overhelmed. Ever since I saw that, my mind can't stop thinking about Mr.Hyde. I don't understand how humans are able to create **something** that can harm themselves socially, physically and mentally too. To be honest, I'm not sure if \"harm\" is the correct word because when I saw Mr.Hyde I understood it all. You just wanted to be \"free\" with no **one** saying you what to do, whether it was right or wrong. But, you didn't **think** about the consequences and now you're there, at the edge of the abyss.If there were anything I **could** do to help you, I'd do it. But I don't **know** what to do and maybe neither do you.I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.The only **thing** I can do is wish you luck and I hope you live the rest of your days in peace.I'm finishing my letter here.Farewell, my dear comrade.Your best friend."

       "4.4/5Frances Hodgkin Burnett has a **way** of evoking sympathetic human emotions in a magically, beautiful, child-**like**, simple **way**.Quotes:Oh Sara!’ she whispered joyfully, ‘it is **like** a story!’‘It is a story,’ **said** Sara. ‘Everything's a story - You are a story – I am a story.’  ‘Things happen to **people** by accident,’ she used to **say**. ‘A lot of nice accidents have happened to me. It just happened that I always liked lessons and books, and **could** remember **things** when I learned them. It just happened that I was born with a father who was beautiful and nice and clever, and **could** give me everything I liked. Perhaps I have not really a **good** temper at all, but if you have everything you **want** and everyone is kind to you, how can you help but be **good**-tempered? I don’t **know**’ – looking quite serious – ‘how shall I ever find out whether I am really a nice child or a horrid **one**. Perhaps I’m a hideous child, and no **one** will ever **know**, just because I **never** have any trials.’  ‘You are always supposing **things**,’ **said** Lavinia, and her air was very superior.‘I **know** I am,’ **said** Sara undisturbedly. ‘I **like** it. There is nothing so nice as supposing. It’s almost **like** being a fairy. If you suppose anything hard enough it seems as if it were real.’  ‘You are nicer than I am,’ **said** Sara. ‘I was too proud to try and **make** new friends. You **see**, now that trials have come, they have shown me that I am not a nice child. I was afraid they **would**. Perhaps’ – wrinkling her forehead wisely – ‘that is what they were sent for.’  ‘Sara,’ she **said**, ‘do you **think** you can bear living here?’Sara looked round also.‘If I pretend it’s quite different, I can,’ she answered.‘Or if I pretend it is a place in a story.’  When **people** are insulting you, there is nothing so **good** for them as not to **say** a word – just to look at them and **think**.  There’s nothing so strong as rage, except what makes you hold it in – that’s stronger. It’s a **good** **thing** not to answer your enemies.  [Sara watching a wonderful sunset from the rooftop]‘It’s a Splendid **one**,’ **said** Sara softly to herself. ‘It makes me feel almost afraid – as if **something** strange was just going to happen. The Splendid ones always **make** me feel **like** that.’   She looked at him interestedly for a second, and then smiled across the slates. She had learned to **know** how comforting a smile, **even** from a stranger, may be.  It **would** be easy to be a princess if I were dressed in cloth of gold, but it is a great deal more of a triumph to be **one** all the time when no **one** knows it.  ‘Perhaps you can feel if you can’t hear,’ was her fancy. ‘Perhaps kind thoughts reach **people** somehow, **even** through windows and doors and walls.’  Anyone who is kind wants to **know** when **people** have been made happy. They care for that more than for being thanked.  Perhaps there is a language which is not made of words and everything in the **world** understands it.  Perhaps to be able to learn **things** quickly isn't everything. To be kind is worth a great deal to other **people**...Lots of clever **people** have done harm and have been wicked"

And so is the hurt we cause others unknowingly. If only I’d understood then what I **know** now! He **said**. But how **could** he? There is so much we don’t understand. And so much unhappiness comes because of that. She **say**, Celie, tell the truth, have you ever found God in church? I **never** did. I just found a bunch of folks hoping for him to show. Any God I ever felt in church I brought in with me. And I **think** all the other folks did too. They come to church to share God, not find God. Here’s the **thing**, **say** Shug. The **thing** I believe. God is inside you and inside everybody else. You come into the **world** with God. But only them that search for it inside find it. And sometimes it just manifest itself **even** if you not looking, or don’t **know** what you looking for. Trouble do it for most folks, I **think**. Sorrow, lord. Feeling **like** shit. Oh, she **say**. God love all them feelings [sexual]. That’s some of the best stuff God did. And when you **know** God loves ‘em you enjoys ‘em a lot more. You can just relax, go with everything that’s going, and praise God by liking what you **like**.God don’t **think** it dirty? I ast.Naw, she **say**. God made it. Listen, God love everything you love – and a mess of stuff you don’t. But more than anything else, God love admiration.You saying God vain? I ast.Naw, she **say**. Not vain, just wanting to share a **good** **thing**. I **think** it pisses God off if you walk by the color purple in a field somewhere and don’t notice it.What it do when it pissed off? I ast.Oh, it **make** **something** else. People **think** pleasing God is all God care about. But any fool living in the **world** can **see** it always trying to please us back.Yeah? I **say**.Yeah, she **say**. It always making little surprises and springing them on us when us least expect.You mean it **want** to be loved, just **like** the bible **say**.Yes, Celie, she **say**. Everything **want** to be loved. Us sing and dance, **make** faces and give flower bouquets, trying to be loved. You ever notice trees do everything to git attention we do, except walk? God is different to us now, after all these years in Africa. More spirit than ever before, and more internal. Most **people** **think** he has to look **like** **something** or someone – a roofleaf or Christ – but we don’t. And not being tied to what God looks **like**, frees us. Just cause I love her don’t take away none of her rights I **think** us here to wonder, myself. To wonder. To ast. And that in wondering bout the big **things** and asting bout the big **things**, you learn about the little ones, almost by accident. But you **never** **know** nothing more about the big **things** than you start with. The more I wonder, he **say**, the more I love. If she come, I be happy. If she don’t, I be content.And then I figure this the lesson I was suppose to learn."

That’s why it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.”این کتاب از اوناییه که به نظرم واقعا پنج حقشونه. شاید اوایلش اصلا فکر نمی کردم بیشتر از سه بهش بدم، ولی الان حتی به همون قسمت های شروعش هم پنج می دم :) + خوندن کتاب خیلی زجر آور بود در کل::)))) خوندن داستان نه، ولی خوندن کتابی که عرضش اینقدر کوچیک بود که میانه های کتاب اصلا درست و حسابی باز نمی شد و با یه فونت کوچولو تا اون آخرش هم نوشته بودن، اذیت می کرد یکم. اونم من، که حتی وقت بود جداً و درست و حسابی کتاب دست نگرفته بودم و حسابی به ای بوک و تبلت عادت کردم :( در کل مواظب تبلت هاتون باشین که به عاقبت من دچار نشین =)) + ولی با این وجود، خیلی خوشحالم که یه انتشارات ( انتشارات جنگل ) کتابای زبان اصلی رو با این کیفیت و قیمت کاملاً مناسب چاپ می کنه.  + من تموم سعیم رو کردم که اسپویل نکنم، ولی اگه نخوندین، ترجیحاً این ریویو رو هم نخونین :)داستان اول شخص بود، به روایت یه دختر هشت ساله ( البته ماجراهای کتاب توی سه سال اتفاق افتادن. فکر می کنم اولش هفت سالش بود و آخر کتاب نه. ) به اسم جین لوییس فینج که اسکات صداش می کردن. اوایل یه کم برام عجیب بود یه دختر هفت-هشت ساله اینطوری حرف بزنه و رفتار کنه، ولی هر چی که جلوتر می رفت و با محیط زندگیش بیشتر آشنا می شدم، قابل درک تر می شد. اسکات یه دختره که خوشش نمیاد مثل خانم ها بشه و به نظر من، لجباز و مغروره. به همین دلیل هم هیچ وقت نمی بینیم که بگه که اتفاقات اطرافش رو درک نمی کنه، ولی همین حرف زدن و اظهار نظر کردن هاش کاملاً مشخص می کرد که هنوز خیلی بچه ست. شخصیت پردازی ها رو خیلی دوست داشتم. اسکات، برادرش جم ( جرمی )، پدرشون، همسایه ها و... خوب پردازش شده بودن. با اینکه شخصیتشون از دیدگاه یه دختر بچه روایت می شد که اصلا هم بی طرف نبود، ولی کاملا بهت اجازه می داد که خودت در موردشون قضاوت کنی. به شدت آتیکوس، پدر اسکات رو دوست داشتم. اخلاق و رفتار و حرف زدنش عالی بود. یه وکیل حدوداً پنجاه ساله، که به نظر من یه پدر خیلی خوب بود. تا حدوداً پنج فصل اول که اصلا به مکالمات محاوره ای شخصیت ها عادت نکرده بودم، آتیکوس تنها کسی بود که درست و حسابی حرف می زد و می شد حرف هاشو فهمید =)) خود شخصیتش هم کاملاً آدم رو جذب می کرد.“he did not do the **things** our schoolmates’ fathers did: he **never** went hunting, he did not play poker or fish, or drink or smoke. He sat in the living room and read.” آتیکوس نسبت به سن بچه هاش پیر محسوب می شه و اونا هم تا قبل از اینکه فهمیدن که پدرشون بهترین تیرانداز شهر بوده و اونو گذاشته کنار، همون تفکرات بالا رو نسبت بهش داشتن. ولی بعد که متوجه می شن، اتیکوس بهشون می گه: wanted you to **see** what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It's when you **know** you're licked before you begin, but you begin anyway and **see** it through no matter what.حرفاش... وای خدا حرفاش...“You **never** really understand a person until you consider **things** from his point of view... Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it.”من از قبل تقریباً می دونستم داستان چی هست، برای همین تا نصفه های کتاب فقط منتظر بودم داستان اون موکل آتیکوس پیش بیاد. ولی موضوع این بود که از نظر اسکات، داستان اصلی داستان پدرش نبود، داستان خودش و جم بود و ماجرای شکسته شدن دست جم.و برای همین هم اسکات هر جایی که خودش لازم می دونه برای تعریف داستان نیازه رو اضافه می کنه. این رو خیلی خیلی دوست داشتم و واقعاً هم لذت بردم. نویسنده کاری کرده بود که توی تمام کتاب این حس که راوی یه دختر بچه ست حس بشه و در عین حال، اون پیام زیبا رو داخلش بگنجونه. حتی یه جاهایی توی کتاب بود که اسکات شروع می کرد و به شکل تقریباً بی فایده ای از یه چیزای خاصی صحبت می کرد و توی همین صحنه ها هم، لحنش متفاوت بود. یه جا داشت صحبت های معلمش رو توضیح می داد و نسبتاً بی حوصله بود، یه جا داشت در مورد پدرش صحبت می کرد و هیجان زده بود و الی آخر. من این حس رو که یه بچه نشسته و داره این داستان رو برام تعریف می کنه رو توی کل داستان داشتم و خیلی برام خوشایند بود.یه بار دادگاه از آتیکوس می خواد که وکالت یه مرد سیاه پوست رو توی یه پرونده ی تجاوز بر عهده بگیره. خانواده ی دختر معتقدن که این مرد مجرمه و خودش هم انکار می کنه. جدا از نتیجه ی پرونده، همین نژاد پرستی مردم شهر و جبهه گرفتنشون علیه تام – همون متهم – و خانواده ی فینچ ها؛ و اتفاقاتی که به خاطر همین پرونده برای خانواده شون میوفته خیلی قشنگ و تاثیر گذاره. آتیکوس می گه که همیشه توی زندگی یه وکیل، یه پرونده هست که روی زندگیش تاثیر می ذاره و پرونده تام برای اون همین حکم رو داره. با اینکه مردم شهر مسخره ش می کنن و می گن عاشق سیاه پوست ها شده و حتی خواهر خودشم می گه کارش اشتباهه، می گه:“They're certainly entitled to **think** that, and they're entitled to full respect for their opinions... but before I can live with other folks I've got to live with myself. The **one** **thing** that doesn't abide by majority rule is a person's conscience.” یه جای کتاب هست که آتیکوس می گه این بی عدالتی ها هر روز اتفاق میوفته، و بعضی وقتا فقط بچه ها هستن که به خاطرش گریه می کنن. یا یه جای دیگه اسکات می گه یه روز شنیده معلمشون میگفته که این سیاه پوست ها خیلی دارن پررو می شن و باید یه درسی بهشون داد؛ دیگه همین کمه که بخوان با بچه ها مون ازدواج کنن و همین معلم یه جای دیگه سر کلاس به بچه ها می گه که از هیتلر متنفره، به خاطر اینکه یهودی ها رو فقط به خاطر اینکه با خودش هم اعتقاد نیستن کشته. اسکات این رو نمی فهمه و واقعا ًاز پدرش می پرسه چطور چنین چیزی ممکنه. در اون لحظه جداً می خواستم کتاب رو بذارم کنار و بشینم گریه کنم. علاوه بر این موضوع، داستان همون دختر شاکی هم هست که وقتی آتیکوس خانم صداش می زنه یا ازش می پرسه دوستی داری یا نه، دختره فکر می کنه مسخره ش کردن. زندگی دختر رو به تصویر می کشه و می ذاره خودت در مورد زندگیش تصمیم بگیری...فکر می کنم این کتاب یکی از بهترین کتابایی بود که خوندم، و فکر می کنم که بعداً هم خواهم خوندشون، و به هر کسی هم که بتونم توصیه خواهم کرد :)If there's just **one** kind of folks, why can't they get along with each other? If they're all alike, why do they go out of their **way** to despise each other? Scout, I **think** I'm beginning to understand **something**. I **think** I'm beginning to understand why Boo Radley's stayed shut up in the house all this time. It's because he wants to stay inside."

       "Alice's Adeventures in Wonderlandby Lewis CarrollHutchinson (RHCP), 1989ISBN: 9780091737641A classic children's book. Alice follows a white rabbit down a rabbit hole and finds herself in a strange land. Nothing makes sense and everyone she encounters is odd. This is a fun book. It's silly and whimsical and doesn't **make** any sense. I don't remember ever reading this book as a child, but I definitely enjoyed it as an adult. Love the riddles, and it really is all rather curious. Favorite quotes:\"and what is the use of a book,\" thought Alice, \"without pictures or conversations?\"\"That depends a **good** deal on where you **want** to get to,\" **said** the Cat.\"I don’t much care where --\" **said** Alice.\"Then it doesn’t matter which **way** you walk,\" **said** the Cat.\"--so long as I get somewhere,\" Alice added as an explanation.\"Oh, you’re sure to do that,\" **said** the Cat, \"if you only walk long enough.”“Begin at the beginning\" the King **said**, gravely, \"and go on till you come to the end: then stop.”"

       "I can spend hours quoting various parts of this book and yet I still will not be able to entirely prove the exquisiteness that is in book. This book is well-known enough that I **know** it needs no explanation about its story. Everyone must **know** by now about how it ends.   \"It often seems to me that art conceals the artist far more completely than it ever reveals him\" (Coincidentally, same is the case for writing     \"The artist is the creator of beautiful **things**.To reveal art and conceal the artist is art’s aim.The critic is he who can translate into another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful **things**.The highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography.Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful **things** are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault.Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful **things** are the cultivated. For these there is hope.They are the elect to whom beautiful **things** mean only Beauty.There is no such **thing** as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written. That is all\"    We can forgive a man for making a useful **thing** as long as he does not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless **thing** is that **one** admires it intensely.All art is quite useless  Oscar Wilde **never** seemed to me as a bitter person. Until I read Dorian Gray. Of course **people** will call me biased now for calling him cruel or stereotypical but that is the **way** I **think**. However, here is what differentiates Oscar from every other author out there; where every awful author makes sure to ridicule **people** and **make** you hate them for it, Oscar still manages to captivate you with his story and with his words despite spewing words that **would** have offended you if you had heard them from a person in this modern age. I **think** that is the point of his whole books and why English teachers rave on about his books in their classes. He has changed the point of reading entirely for me from now on. I cannot **think** the same **way**. I cannot **even** **make** choices the same **way** anymore either.  Because to influence a person is to give him **one**’s own soul.   The **one** **thing** that struck me the most in his book was his justification for the use of drugs, alcohol and other means to forget memories. Dorian uses opium to forget the crime he commits and he is reminded of what Sir Henry **said** to him \"....that is **one** of the great secrets of life – to cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of the soul\".   And this made me wonder if that was the key I had been missing all along. If all I needed was to cure my soul using my senses. That is the magic of this book; it makes you contemplate **things** in ways you have **never** imagined before.  Behind every exquisite **thing** that existed, there was **something** tragic   My favorite quotes from the entire book were:  The only **things** **one** **never** regrets are **one**’s mistakes    People are very fond of giving away what they need most themselvesHe lives the poetry that he cannot write. The others write the poetry that they dare not realizeIt is **said** that passion makes **one** **think** in a circleThere are moments, psychologists tell us, when the passion for sin, or for what the **world** calls sin, so dominates a nature, that every fibre of the body, as every cell of the brain, seems to be instinct with fearful impulsesThe **things** **one** feels absolutely certain about are **never** trueThe books that the **world** calls immoral are books that show the **world** its own shameBut then **one** regrets the loss **even** of **one**’s worst habits\"The secret of life is to reproduce that experience as often as possible.’‘Even when **one** has been wounded by it, Harry?’ asked the Duchess, after a pause.‘Especially when **one** has been wounded by it,’ answered Lord Henry.     There were moments when he looked on evil simply as a mode through which he **could** realize his conception of the beautiful.  "

If we truly abandon everything that makes us male and female for some androgynous ideal that we'll be unhappy, besides being impossible anyhow. There is a great wrong that's been done to women through the ages, they **never** received acknowledgment for the labor they performed and the societies they created and I agree that almost all the blame lies on men. I find it frustrating that so many **people** feel the solution lies with \"equality\" in some strange universe maybe, where **people** can somehow change genders at will or where there is no difference between them. I will always agree with my friend who quoted I don't **know** who when she **said**, \"until homemaking can be seen as an honorable profession equality cannot be achieved\". So go ahead Virginia Woolf, yell out whatever injustices you **want**, I agree with so many of them it makes me sick to **think** of what men have done against women through the ages, but the idea that by giving up what makes us men and women will **make** us happy is absurd."

These **people** go to a 'wizard' to grant their wish, from which they all get placebos. The placebos **make** these characters believe that their 'prayers' have been answered, so to speak. In reality, we have the power to fulfill our own requests. This is just the surface; there are also little details that draw me to this conclusion, but this is just a review--no need to prove my claim.Anyways, I really **like** the poppy field scene. Taking in too much of the beautiful smell will knock a person out forever--unless someone pulls them out and revives them. This seems to symbolize **things** such as drugs and alcohol (to me).

       "**quotes & pictures = possible spoilers!**What can I **say** about this wonderful book that hasn't already been **said**? I **think** Emma might just be my favourite of all the Austen novels. I enjoyed it immensely and I am so glad I finally read it!Meet Emma Woodhouse; \"handsome, clever and rich, with a comfortable home and a happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence.\" And Mr. Knightley, \"a sensible man with a cheerful manner that always did him **good**\" and who \"always moved with the alertness of a mind which **could** neither be undecided nor dilatory.\"\"One half of the **world** cannot understand the pleasure of the other.\"\"Were I to fall in love, indeed, it **would** be a different **thing**; but I have **never** been in love; it is not my **way**, or my nature; and I do not **think** I ever shall.\"\"Seldom, very seldom, does complete truth belong to any human disclosure; seldom can it happen that **something** is not a little disguised or a little mistaken.\"\"Men of sense, whatever you may chose to **say**, do not **want** silly wives!\"\"The most incomprehensible **thing** to a man is a woman who rejects his offer of marriage!\"\"The ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant, 'Men **never** **know** when **things** are dirty or not;' and the gentlemen perhaps thought each to himself, 'Women will have their little nonsense and needless cares.\"Come, let us be friends and **say** no more about it.\"\" 'Whom are you going to dance with?' 'With you, if you will ask me.' 'Will you?' **said** he, offering his hand. 'Why yes! We are not so much brother and sister as to **make** it improper.' 'Brother and sister! No indeed!' \"\"I always deserve the best treatment because I **never** put up with any other.\"\"Wickedness is always wickedness but folly is not always folly.\"\"My dearest Emma,\" **said** he, \"for dearest you will always be, whatever the event of this hour's conversation, my dearest, most beloved Emma -- tell me at once. Say 'No,' if it is to be **said**.\" She **could** really **say** nothing. \"You are silent,\" he cried, with great animation; \"absolutely silent! at present I ask no more.\"Emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment. The dread of being awakened from the happiest dream, was perhaps the most prominent feeling.\"I cannot **make** speeches, Emma,\" he soon resumed; and in a tone of such sincere, decided, intelligible tenderness as was tolerably convincing. \"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you **know** what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me. I have blamed you, and lectured you, and you have borne it as no other woman in England **would** have borne it. Bear with the truths I **would** tell you now, dearest Emma, as well as you have borne with them. The manner, perhaps, may have as little to recommend them. God knows, I have been a very indifferent lover. But you understand me. Yes, you **see**, you understand my feelings and will return them if you can. At present, I ask only to hear, once to hear your voice.\" \"This sweetest and best of all creatures, faultless in spite of all her faults.\"\"What had she to wish for? Nothing, but to grow more worthy of him, whose intentions and judgement had been ever so superior to her own. Nothing but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in the future.\" Emma and Knightley <3 "

       "I really disliked this book. I dislike it in the **way** that I dislike a great deal of modern self help books. Their basic message is that if you **want** **something** to happen, you need to **want** it as hard as you can, without caring about anything else, not allowing yourself to doubt it, or let criticisms will get in the **way** then it will happen.I disagree with this notion, not only because it is false, but because it is bad.Just because we desire **something**, does not **make** it **good**. This idea of 'following your heart' is often wrong. Who are we to be the arbiters of truth? Why should our hearts be sources of information that go beyond logic, doubt and reasoning? Haven't we all desired **things** that have turned out to not be in our best interest, or to be harmful to others? Andrew Jackson was a man known to have a lot of integrity. He was always 'true' to himself and followed his heart. Andrew Jackson is the man who initiated the 'Trail of Tears'. Moving Native Americans from their homes and into reservations. Next, this idea of not letting ourselves doubt or consider doubts. This is a terrible and dishonest **way** to live. If we don't consider doubts, and entertain them often, then we are deliberately blinding ourselves. Deliberately making ourselves ignorant. If someone doesn't give serious consideration to the idea that they may be wrong. Give serious thought to why they believe what they do, and that perhaps those who doubt them may be correct, then they are behaving in a dangerous and dishonest **way**.Not giving heed to the concerns doubts and criticisms of others is **something** I believe is a major fault in modern society. Often, **people** fail to recognize the needs of the group and the community. We place so much emphasis on the needs and rights of the individual. This causes **people** to focus so much on themselves to the detriment of others around them. At times, it can be beneficial to go against the group, but **one** should first give serious consideration to the groups concerns.According to Ideas **like** the Alchemist, groups **like**, the Westboro Baptist Church,(godhatesfags.com) should be seen as American heroes. These are **people** who take a totally irrational stance, and stick to it as hard as they can in complete defiance to the views of everyone around them."

       "Having previously seen an anime series based on this book, I knew parts of the story well but had always wanted to read the book. After reading, I can **say** it is a really **good** read. The descriptions are beautiful. Though Sara seemed a little too perfect sometimes, she really is a lovely little soul. I wanted her to have a happy ending which she eventually did. All in all, A Little Princess by Frances Hodgson Burnett touched my heart.Quotes:“Perhaps to be able to learn **things** quickly isn't everything. To be kind is worth a great deal to other **people**...Lots of clever **people** have done harm and have been wicked.” “I am a princess. All girls are. Even if they live in tiny old attics. Even if they dress in rags, **even** if they aren't pretty, or smart, or young. They’re still princesses.” “Somehow, **something** always happens just before **things** get to the very worst. It is as if Magic did it. If I **could** only just remember that always. The worse **thing** **never** quite comes.” “I don't **know** who it is,\" she **said**; \"but somebody cares for me a little. I have a friend.” Lessons Learnt:The **world** is full of magic. You just have to wait for it to happen to you. The most important **thing** isn't to be the most intelligent nor the most beautiful person. The most important **thing** in life is to be a **good** person. A person who is kind and generous. A person who has a **good** heart.Even if **one** is miserable and feels **like** there is no **one** to help them, there is always someone who cares. There is always someone who is a friend.Everyone is special no matter where they come from. No matter where they are going.At a moment where all seems dark, where there is no **way** out, there will be magic. The magic that makes **things** better. The magic that doesn't let the worst **thing** happen. One must always remember that."

It's my belief that Lewis Carroll was probably **one** of the most intelligent **people** who ever lived, and this shines through clearly in his writing. How can **something** be so logical, yet so nonsensical at the same time?2. The poems - Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is full of poetry. Some funny (The Lobster Quadrille), some clever (You are old, Father William), and some just beautiful (All In The Golden Afternoon).3. Alice herself is such a doll, don't you **think**? So bright, and curious, and witty, and a bit precocious, actually, but I kind of **like** that. 4. Only in this book **could** you have a mouse delivering history lessons, a baby morphing into a piglet, and flamingos as croquet mallets, and have it somehow **make** perfect sense. 5. This time around, I read the Salvador Dali edition of the book, and his illustrations are **something** else. I **want** them framed in my room or **something**.

My friend Nata suggested this book to me, and **even** though I am only fourteen, I feel **like** I just appreciated life a bit more than ever before. Everyone in this **world** will die, and who knows what happens next, so I learnt that its now or **never** to do **something** **good** and **make** yourself happy. I will always keep this quote in mind: \"Once you learn how to die, you learn how to live\". One of the **things** I learnt about this quote is that **people** don't accept that **one** day we will be here and the next, gone. Once they do realize it though, its really to late because most of their life is already gone at old age. I'm sorry that this review doesn't contain **good** grammar and writing, but I am writing from my heart about how much I have learnt from this book because it had really touched me. "

When I asked a mother why she thought this, she **said**: A girl is nothing to herself, only to her husband can she become **something**. What can she become? I asked. Why, she **said**, the mother of his children. But I am not the mother of anybody's children, I **said**, and I am **something**. You are not much, she **said**. The missionary's drudge. p. 155Even though they are unhappy and work **like** donkeys they still **think** it is an honor to be the chief's wife. Why do they **say** I will be a wife of the chief? asks Olivia. That is as high as they can **think**, I tell her. p. 157Anyhow, I **say**, the God I been praying and writing to is a man. And act just **like** all the other mens I **know**. Trifling, forgitful and lowdown. p. 192You telling me God love you, and you ain't **never** done nothing for him? I mean, not go to church, sing in the choir, feed the preacher and all **like** that? But if God love me, Celie, I don't have to do all that. Unless I **want** to. There's a lot of other **things** I can do that I spec God likes. Like what? I ast. Oh, she **say**. I can lay back and just admire stuff. Be happy. Have a **good** time. Well, this sound **like** blasphemy sure nuff. She **say**, Celie, tell the truth, have you ever found God in church? I **never** did. I just found a bunch of folks hoping for him to show. Any God I ever felt in church I brought in with me. And I **think** all the other folks did too. They come to church to share God, not find God. p. 193God love all them feelings. That's some of the best stuff God did. And when you **know** God loves 'em you enjoys 'em a lot more. You can just relax, go with everything that's going, and praise God by liking what you **like**. p. 196I **think** it pisses God off if you walk by the color purple in a field somewhere and don't notice it. p. 196People **think** pleasing God is all God care about. But any fool living in the **world** can **see** it always trying to please us back. p. 196You have to git man off your eyeball, before you can **see** anything a'tall. Man corrupt everything, **say** Shug. He on your box of grits, in your head, and all over the radio. He try to **make** you **think** he everywhere. Soon as you **think** he everywhere, you **think** he God. But he ain't. Whenever you trying to pray, and man plop himself on the other end of it, tell him to git lost, **say** Shug. Conjure up flowers, wind, water, a big rock. p. 197He laugh. Who you **think** you is? he **say**. You can't curse nobody. Look at you. You black, you pore, you ugly, you a woman. Goddam, he **say**, you nothing at all. p. 206It didn't take long to realize I didn't hardly **know** nothing. And that if you ast yourself why you black or a man or a woman or a bush it don't mean nothing if you don't ask why you here, period. So what you **think**? I ask. I **think** us here to wonder, myself. To wonder. To ask. And that in wondering bout the big **things** and asking bout the big **things**, you learn about the little ones, almost by accident. But you **never** **know** nothing more about the big **things** than you start out with. The more I wonder, she **say**, the more I love. p. 282I took six months reading this book because it was on my phone, and that's not how I usually read. The writing was beautiful and the story depressing but hopeful. A great book for women. Lots of **good** quotes."

That's the **world**'s greatest lie.\" \"...when you **want** **something**, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.\"\"His **way** is not the same as mine, nor mine as his. But we're both in search of our destinies, and I respect him for that.\"\"Because **people** become fascinated with pictures and words, and wind up forgetting the Language of the World.\"\"The day after we met, Fatima **said**, you told me that you loved me. Then, you taught me **something** of the universal language and the Soul of the World. Because of that, I have become a part of you.\"\"How do I guess the future? Based on the omens of the present. The secret is here in the present. If you pay attention to the present, you can improve upon it. And, if you improve on the present, what comes later will also be better. Forget the future, and live each day according to the teachings, confident that God loves his children. Each day, in itself, brings with it an eternity.\" \"Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than suffering itself. And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a second's encounter with God and with eternity.\"\"Don't give into your fears, **said** the alchemist, in a strangely gentle voice, If you do, you won't be able to talk to your heart.\"\"If a person is living out his destiny, he knows everything he needs to **know**. There is only **one** **thing** that makes a dream impossible to achieve: fear of failure.\"\"Love is the force that transforms and improves the Soul of the World.\" "

All earlier **reviews** (apart from the last **one**, which is sight unseen), refer to previous editions of the book.I bought this to replace my Penguin **copy** of the 1970 revised version of the 1960 original, so I haven't seen the expanded versions which appeared between 1970 and 2015. It's going to take several months to **read** the whole book; so far I've just flipped through and dipped into a few entries, which are a lot more detailed than in the 1970 **edition**.The book is beautiful - the extra colour illustrations make all the difference. If you're a Carroll fan and don't already have **one** of the expanded versions it's an essential addition to your library. I can't give a link here, but an online search for this **edition** and \"**review**\" will bring up a detailed **review** **published** in The New Yorker. You can get a good idea of what it looks like from the page photographs Amazon have included.At least **one** of the pages in my **copy** has a mark from the printing process, but it's of minor importance and I'm not going to change it in case the next **copy** is worse. Also, check out the measurements of this book before buying - it's more or less square and fits very oddly onto a bookshelf!"

       "I only **read** Oliver Twist by Charles Dickens once, back in 6th grade when I was about 12 **years** old. It was **one** of the classic books I'd received as a Christmas present, and I loved Dickens other children's stories, so I had to **read** this **one**. It's much more harsh tho, and might be a little difficult for a 12 **year** old to take in without having a better picture of the world. It's **one** of those books nagging at the back of my mind... \"Please re-**read** me. I bet you'll like me a whole lot more.\" And it's probably true... so perhaps I can **find** some **time** to squeeze this **one** in for the **year**. I **read** a lot of older books, but I should throw in a \"classic\" or \"pre-19th century\" book every ten books or so... just to keep me ed-u-ma-ca-ted.Several key things about the book to help you decide if you want to **read** it:1. The catch phrase: can I have so more, may I have another please...2. Commentary about life being poor3. Written in 1838... almost 200 **years** old!4. A happy endingNot a spoiler: I'm just saying... we all die sometime, right?5. Adventure for a young adult / kid6. Truly understanding what an orphan meant -- they have scissors for hands, right?\n",

I **first** **read** this in high school and then again in college as part of a course on Shakespeare. Then I watched a few movie versions. It's full of so much humor and creativity. The plot is essentially the impacts of magic, as some fairy dust causes everyone to fall in love with the **first** person they see -- once the dust falls on them. Imagine the hilarity that ensues in a chain reaction of who loves who. If you want to **read** a comedy, this would be **one** of the top 3.

According to Cassandra Austen's Memorandum, Susan (as it was **first** called) was written approximately during 1798–99. It was revised by Austen for the press in 1803, and sold in the same **year** for £10 to a London bookseller, Crosby & Co., who decided against publishing. In 1817, the bookseller was content to sell it back to the novelist's brother, Henry Austen, for the exact sum — £10 — that he had paid for it at the beginning, not knowing that the writer was by then the author of four popular novels. The novel was further revised before being brought out posthumously in late December 1817 (1818 given on the title-page), as the **first** two volumes of a four-volume set with Persuasion.A TV movie Northanger Abbey (TV 2007) was made based on this book.I wouldn't say this **one** of my favorite Austen's book, but I liked its gothic aspect."

       "3+ of 5 stars to Anne of Green Gables, the **first** book in a series by L.M. Montgomery, written in 1902. I **read** this book nearly 30 **years** ago and had to refresh my memory a little, before writing the **review**. I'd forgotten it was part of a whole series. I **read** more than **one**, but not sure which other ones. I recall this **first** **one**... a tale about an orphan girl, acclimating to a **new** family, meeting friends and neighbors. On the outskirts, it's a coming-of-age tale about a young girl becoming a woman and learning about the realities of life. It's both a funny book to **read** and an educational **one** with some lessons. It's something every kid should **read**, just to understand how good they have it... or if they are adopted, to learn how to deal with it. Anne's a beautiful person, forgetting age for a few seconds. And whenever she's around, it sorta feels like the comforts of home. If you haven't sampled it, **read** **one** of the books in the series just to see what life was like for a girl like her over a century ago. It'll be a positive **read**, even so **many** **years** later.\n",

I **first** found the books when I was 14 and had to re-**read** again when the movies came out in the last decade or so.

Miller is brilliant, I acknowledge it. He bring suspense, timing and charisma in everything he does. But when this is about an episode from our history over 250 **years** before the play was written, I expected something a bit different / stronger. Too **many** scenes were too dry for me.So **many** schools put this play on as a high school production. Even in colleges sometimes. I was tempted to look for it on Broadway... I mean, I do live in NYC. Why wouldn't I go try it out? Really... I blame myself here.Characters are great. You do feel strong emotions towards them. I think what I wanted more of... was the mysterious air surrounding those deemed a witch. There are some scenes where it's almost there for me, but ultimately... I wanted more. I should probably give it another chance... it's been almost 25 **years**.\n",

Well, I do have a lengthy **review** I could include from a previous course on Shakespeare, but I will not do so here... chance are you've already **read** the play or seen some film adaption, perhaps even a staged version. I've seen a bunch of them and **read** the place 4 times (once in high school, twice in college and once just for pleasure). Here's the thing about this play: There is WAY too much to absorb in just **one** or two reads. Each **time** you **read** the play, you pick up on **new** interpretations, **new** meanings and **new** thought patterns. Each **time** you watch a **new** performance, the actors and directors choose a different angle or approach. Hamlet is all of us. And we will always take from it something we want to believe... likely based on what's going on in our life at that **time**. If you are having relationship issues, you'll probably focus on that aspect of Hamlet's life. If you feel depressed, you'll questions \"to be or not to be.\" If you are happy, you'll root for him to do the right things. I'm not sure if that's how Shakespeare intended it to happen, but he certainly left it open on purpose. Maybe not to allow us to have completely widespread views and interpretations, but enough to choose the key things we want to focus on. I think maybe I need to **read** it again this summer!\n",

The publisher, John Lane, opined that this courtroom scene was not convincing and he requested that she amend it. Christie agreed to a rewrite. The explanation of the crime remains the same where Poirot unveils the murderer in the drawing room of Styles in the kind of dénouement that would be replicated in **many** later books. This **edition** of The Mysterious Affair at Styles is the **first** to restore Christie's original unpublished courtroom ending to her book. Was John Lane right in insisting on a rewrite? Well, the reader has the opportunity to decide as both versions of chapter 12 \"The Last Link\" are included in this **new** **edition**. A unique **edition** and a definite keeper for me.TMAAS is a very well contrived, skilful tale - full of surprises as Hercule Poirot uses his little grey cells and powers of detection to **find** out who poisoned the wealthy Emily Inglethorp. How did the murderer penetrate and escape from her locked bedroom? And the amiable Captain Hastings is on the scene to help (or **one** might muse - hinder!).If you haven't **read** TMAAS and you enjoy a classic whodunit, treat yourself to a **copy** of this unique **edition**.

       "4 out of 5 stars to The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde written in 1886 by Robert Louis Stevenson. So here's how naive I was **years** ago... and keep in mind I was an English major who loved the classics... I'd **read** some short stories about Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde as a teenager, maybe saw some video or tv versions.... can't quite remember. Sophomore **year** in college, this is listed on the assigned syllabus for **one** of my courses. And I'm like \"I think there's a mistake. Stevenson wrote Treasure Island.

The machine mainly goes into the future from where he lives, and what he finds is a future where mankind is greatly changed.

Ale + Ale has a collage plus digital style that has vivid color, yet feels pretty classic and fits well with the story.

So **many** forget about it now, think of it as just some non-American book, a romance story or a play or film they watched. WRONG!

       "I haven't been in the Christmas spirit this **year**, so I decided to re-**read** this to see if it would help, and I'm happy to say that it did! Most people are familiar with this heartwarming story, but I'll recap anyway. Ebeneezer Scrooge, known by all to be an insensitive miser, is visited on Christmas Eve by the ghost of his former partner, Jacob Marley. Jacob shares his misery and regrets with Scrooge and introduces three additional visitors: Ghost of Christmas Past, Ghost of Christmas Present, and Ghost of Christmas Future. The ghosts take Scrooge on a field trip, illustrating how events will unfold if he does not change his ways. Dickens is an amazing writer - his characters are rich, his humor is contagious, and **many** authors have attempted to imitate his prose. This is THE classic Christmas tale, capturing what the holiday is all about. It's a short novella, weighing in under 100 pages, so if you haven't **read** it yet, there's still **time** before Christmas. (First **read**: Dec 15, 1988)"

Looking back **years** later, and seeing all the films and cartoons made from it, I love it even more. While she's a good role model in **many** ways for young kids, she's all a little too spunky and might give some the wrong impressions. Nevertheless, with the right guidance, she can be someone to look up to.Not everyone gets the best parents, family, teachers and friends. And when you don't, you better be a smart girl to be able to make it on your own. And that's what she is... brilliant, funny, witty, sarcastic, friendly... everything all wrapped up into 1 adorable young girl. She has a few adventures, tries to make things happen and shows the world who she. And that's all we can ask for! Great book. Great story. Lots to see and learn. Definite re-**read** some day!\n",

(reposted with permission):*****Manny's **review** of another book, the name of which has been edited out because of suspected search engine activity on the part of the regime:\"The **review** below was deleted by Goodreads, along with two others. I received the following message: Re: [#104307] Deleted Reviews Goodreads To Me Oct 11 at 8:41 PM Hello Manny, Your **reviews** of the following books were recently flagged by Goodreads members as potentially off-topic: That's Not What I Meant! Civil Disobedience and Other Essays (Collected Essays) The Hydra As the **reviews** are not about the books in question, they have been removed from the site. You can **find** the text of the **reviews** attached for your personal records. Please note that if you continue to post content like this, your account may come under **review** for removal. Sincerely, The Goodreads TeamSince several other people have already posted copies, it seems illogical for me not to repost. Maybe Goodreads will indeed retaliate by removing my account. If so, it's been nice knowing you all!In the shower just now, I suddenly had a Eureka moment. The aspect of this current censorship war that's been upsetting us most is the feeling of powerlessless. Goodreads can arbitrarily change the rules, and they hardly even bother to respond when we complain. But we are not powerless. There are twenty million of us, and only a few dozen of them. We just need to get a little more organized, and we can easily resist.So here's **one** concrete way to do it, based on the legend of Hercules. You will recall that Hercules had a difficult **time** against the Lernean H***; every **time** he cut off **one** of its heads, ten more grew back. We can do the same thing if we adopt the following plan:1. Back up all your **reviews**, so that you have a **copy** of everything you have posted.2. If you think that **one** of your **reviews** has been unreasonably deleted by Goodreads, repost it with an image of the H*** at the top.3. If you see someone else posting a H*** **review**, make a **copy** of it and post it yourself.We can improve this basic scheme with a little thought; for example, it would be better to have a place where we keep HTML marked-up source of **reviews**, so that they can immediately be reposted with the same formatting, and we need a plan for duplicating deleted shelves. But we can sort that out later. Without getting too bogged down in the details, I'm sure you see what will happen. The net result of Goodreads unreasonably deleting a **review** will be that it immediately comes back in **many** different places.People who know their Greek mythology will be aware that Hercules did in fact defeat the H***, and Goodreads can use the same method if they dare; they can close down the account of anyone who participates in the scheme. That will work, but I am not sure that anything less drastic will be effective. I think Goodreads will be reluctant to escalate to this level. A large proportion of the most active reviewers are now part of the protest movement, and they would be losing much of the content that makes the site valuable. Even more to the point, the media have already started to get interested (maybe you saw the article in the Washington Post). They would love the story, and it would create a mountain of bad publicity for G***s and Am**z*n.I'd say the odds are heavily in our favor. Why don't we try it? I promise now to respond to any H*** calls. \""

       "As I looked over my previously **read** books and searched for **one** that was missing a **review**, Romeo and Juliet stood out to me. But then I thought about it... who doesn't know about this play? Who hasn't **read** it in school sometime in the past? Who hasn't watched a movie version or seen some sort of take on the classic tortured romance story? And why on earth would anyone care to **read** another **review**, let alone my **review**, on it? Exactly. So... don't look for much here as I'm sure most everyone has **read** it already. And I'm not that funny to even make **reading** my opinions worth it. That said... a few shared thoughts about what I've learned from this play:1. Parents exist to torture their children. It's a simple fact. If your child wants X, it is your responsibility to keep X away from him/her.2. Love will always end in disaster. Don't attempt it without proper back-up.3. Even though someone looks dead, they probably aren't. Kill them again just to be sure.4. Your bros or girls don't always have your back.5. Magic powders are the cure for everything. Always trust what you don't understand. And just inhale it like the world is about to end.In all sincerity, I do like the play a lot. I've enjoyed countless interpretations. I think parts of it are brilliant and parts of it are pure illogical nonsense. Every TV show and movie has their own re-appropriation to tell. Not everything can be perfect when it comes to love. But this play certainly teaches a lot of lessons and provides a lot of bumps. And this reader still goes along for the ride...\n",

The **copy** I owned was the Barnes and Noble bind up of The Iliad and The Odyssey translated by Samuel Butler. However that was not the **edition** my class wanted us to **read** and suggested the **edition** they had used for **years** which was the Robert Fagles translation, somewhat reluctantly I bought a second **edition** of this story. Then last **year** everything changed when the fire nation attacked, no but really the **first** translation by a woman was released and what a translation it is. I was instructed to **read** this **edition** and so I did. Well ‘**read**’, I wasn’t thrilled about buying a third **edition** of the same book and so started listening to a YouTube **read** through by Vincent Kirk. He did an amazing job with it and added insightful introductions to some of the books and it was just a joy. I did eventually by a **copy**, the physical book itself is beautiful complete with maps, notes, summaries, glossary and pronunciation guide. And finally the actual **review** of the story: It’s great. No but seriously I’ve got to go write a couple essays about it for class but imagine it won’t be too harrowing a task as the story is such a joy to learn and write about. "

He's all too happy to accept and is surprised to learn that an old acquaintance, a retired Belgian police inspector is a war refugee staying nearby. But when Hastings finds that his hostess has been murdered he enlists the aid of his old acquaintance Hurcule Poirot to investigate. Just finished this and I have to say that I enjoyed it more than I expected I would. While I've enjoyed a few of Ms. Christie's more popular works I'd **read** **reviews** suggesting that this **one** was a less satisfying **read**. I found it to be among her best. This was the **first** episode with Hercule Poirot and she seemed to feel more obliged to stay closer to the trope than in later works. Looking back at the mystery in hind sight the clues were all laid out more clearly than in a few of her later works and she made it more of a solve it yourself challenge as well. It was **also** nice to see the scenes of Hastings on his own before he fell so deeply under the influence of Poirot. By all means this should be **read** by mystery fans and fans of Christie and Poirot as well. I do need to mention that I **read** this in Kindle form (a free **copy**) that I got from Amazon.**com**. While the mystery was still enjoyable, there were several missing illustrations that were clearly referenced in the text that were NOT in the Kindle version I **read**. Given the nature of the mystery, these were missed more than they might have been in another book. "

       "This rating is for this **edition** more so than the story itself (which is a five star book). I won this in a Goodreads giveaway two or three weeks ago and recently received it in the mail. I am mostly happy with this **edition**, definitely more so than the **one** I had before I acquired this particular **one**. So I'm going to list a few pros and cons:\n",
       "Pros\n",
       "-It's clothbound, in a very pretty lilac color-Hardcover (kind of goes with #1, but still)-An okay illustration on the front (pretty much the only **one** I'm okay with really)-Good font, nice size print (not too large or small)-Nice, thick paper used for the pages inside\n",
       "Cons\n",
       "-The lack of a synopsis directly embossed onto the back of the book (maybe in a square like the illustration on the front - just a suggestion). There's a cheap wraparound piece of paper with ads for other classics in the series on the part inside the back cover and a synopsis on the part over the outside-back cover. Not impressed.-The illustrations were FUG ugly. I was mostly in it for the clothbound hardcover side of things, so that didn't bother me too much. They were all muddy, dark and overall disenchanting - not what I would've expected for this particular book. That said, they **also** looked about a hundred **years** old, so I don't know when they dated from originally. Maybe the publisher used them cause they didn't have to pay any royalties????? Don't know.Overall, I like this book. It looks nice with the spine outward on my shelf. I'm actually interested in getting this company's printing of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. I'm hoping the illustrations being so disappointing was a **one**-off thing.***Thank you to both Race Point Publishing (I think that was the publisher) and Goodreads for this giveaway **copy**. I received nothing but the book, and all opinions are completely my own and honest."

I would absolutely hate it today, not because it's poorly written or has no value, but because I'd hate Holden more than anything in the world. I was certainly not a perfect teenager, but I never had that angst as a kid, nor do I have it now. I have maybe 10 days a **year** where I complain a little bit about something, but for the most part, my mouth is shut and I do what I'm supposed to do. Supposed to, as in my own perception, not because someone else tells me to do it. Arguing and railing and running away and getting angry don't come naturally to me, so I couldn't identify with him. That said, I've seen this in others and it was well captured, a bit ahead of its **time**. For those reasons, it's a good book. I'm a little concerned this is the type of book that will no longer be **read**... and teens **reading** it today wouldn't understand it.

       "During December of every **year**, the Morgan Library and Museum in New York City displays the original manuscript **edition** of Charles Dickens’ best-known Christmas novel, A Christmas Carol, which was acquired by the American financier, J. P. Morgan, sometime just before the turn of the Twentieth Century. The manuscript was inherited by his son, J. P. Morgan, Jr., who established the Pierpont Morgan Library in 1924, and included the manuscript in the collection. Conservators at the museum have painstakingly cleaned and restored the manuscript, and it has now been **published** in a **new** **edition** by W. W. Norton & Company. The official publication date is 2017, but the book has been available since early November.This **edition** contains a foreword by Colm Toibin and an introduction by Declan Kiely, placing the book in context, and describing Dickens’ efforts to produce the story, which he did over the space of six weeks. They **also** describe the book’s early reception and the later history of the manuscript itself.Following is the familiar tale of how the notorious skinflint, Ebeneezer Scrooge, is visited by three spirits **one** Christmas Eve and is transformed into a generous man of good will, “as good a friend, as good a master, and as good a man, as the good old city knew, or any other good old city, town, or borough in the good old world…. [A man who] knew how to keep Christmas well, if any man alive possessed the knowledge.”The book is constructed with the original manuscript pages on each left-hand (even-numbered) page, with the corresponding printed version of the story on the right or odd-numbered pages. It is thus possible to **read** the finished book and see the changes that Dickens made as he was writing it. Sadly, this takes some effort. The author’s handwriting leaves a great deal to be desired and the manuscript pages are a bit faint. A reader who wants to seriously study the manuscript pages would be well-advised to have a good magnifying glass close at hand.That said, this is a very nice **edition** of the story, and the forward and the introduction are both very illuminating. This is an **edition** of the book that should appeal to any reader who returns to the story of Scrooge and Tiny Tim every **year** about this **time**.(Please note that a few **years** ago, another attempt was made to do roughly the same thing with this book. I have not seen the earlier effort, but have **read** complaints that it was not very well done. The two editions should not be confused.)"

       "4 out of 5 stars to The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, **one** of the \"Great American Novels\" by Mark Twain **published** in 1884. I've actually **read** this book twice: once as a 14-**year**-old and again in college as part of my **many** American English courses. My interpretations have expanded with the second **read**, but it's still at the core, a very profound book worth **reading** at least once in a lifetime.Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer appear in a few of Twain's novels, but it is in this **one** where Huck truly becomes a character, especially through his relationship with Jim. It's the type of book to openly challenge the norms and ideals of the mid-19th century, relationships between various races, treatment towards fellow humankind. Over 135 **years** later, this book is still pertinent to society today. So much needs to evolve and change, and perhaps with literature, it will move a little more each day -- at least as **one** of the necessary driving forces.At times, I tried to forget that the book was calling out differences between treatment of ethnicity and race in America at the **time**. I wanted to think about it **also** from the perspective of two human beings who needed each other for survival, growth, life experience and comfort. Being color-blind and able to connect with someone, even if you don't see them or no much about them, is an important lesson in life. And **one** so few of us have an opportunity to experience.One book can't change it. One book can't truly explain it. But knowing what was happening 135 **years** ago versus what is happening now is important. As is what people thought back then... not just what they did. If you haven't **read** this, as an American, it's your responsibility. Understand the past and history. Know what it was like. Read it from 135-**year**-old words. And decide what you can do to keep things moving forward at a quicker pace... to help us all figure out how to ditch the differences and embrace the fact that we're all humans who need the same things to survive.\n",

       "4+ out of 5 stars for Death on the Nile, a Hercule Poirot mystery **published** in 1937 by Agatha Christie. This is **one** of Christie's better mysteries, not because of the complexity in the mystery but due to the characters she creates. No **one** is who they appear to be on this ship, and they are all trapped together. It's nearly 100 **years** ago, so how could anyone get on or off the boat without the Captain or the rest of the staff in the know? (No, I'm not giving away a spoiler). Poirot is on vacation this **time**, and he is trying not to work. But when someone turns up dead, he has no choice but to solve this crime. People using different names, a killer trapped with little escape... seems easy to figure out. Add in a bit of archaeological history and all the wonderful things Christie learned on her own Egyptian trips, this is a culture storm waiting to explode. Poirot is at his best, which is usually his most annoying, of times. The upper-class and lower-class exploration in this novel crosses lines **many** times, as does the affairs or confusion over who is or was previously with someone else romantically. So **many** clues, so much fun to guess. And the film adaption does a great job at capturing the different personalities. Great **one** for a beginner to the series!\n",

Let it come in. We **think** we don't deserve love, we **think** if we let it in we'll become too soft. But a wise man named Levine **said** it right. He **said**, \"Love is the only rational act.\"Sometimes you cannot believe what you **see**, you have to believe what you feel. And if you are ever going to have other **people** trust you, you must feel that you can trust them, too--**even** when you're in the dark.

Does he collect butterflies?' They ask: 'How old is he?' 'How many brothers does he have?' 'How much does he weigh?' 'How much money does his father **make**?'

You risk tears if you let yourself be tamed.\"\"And when you're consoled (everyone eventually is consoled), you'll be glad you've known me. You'll always be my friend.

For the moment then and unless any further evidence turns up, we must assume that she is telling the truth.\"Susan looked at him very hard and was quite sure from the expression on his face that he was not making fun of them.\"But how **could** it be true, sir?\" **said** Peter.\"Why do you **say** that?\" asked the Professor.\"Well, for **one** **thing**,\" **said** Peter, \"if it was true why doesn't everyone remember the facts of this story the same **way**?\"\"What has that to do with it?\" **said** the Professor.\"Well, sir, if **something** happened, we all remember the same events.\"\"Do we?\" **said** the Professor; and Peter didn't **know** quite what to **say**.\"But she doesn't seem very sure about some bits,\" **said** Susan. \"Sometimes she **said** two boys were present, and sometimes four. It can't be both.\" \"That is the very **thing** that makes her story so likely to be true,\" **said** the Professor. \"If Dr Ford is trying to remember **something** that happened to her thirty-five years ago, I should not be at all surprised to find that she had trouble recollecting certain aspects. If, on the other hand, she had made everything up, I am sure she **would** have seen to it that such elementary issues as the number of boys present were consistent.\"\"But do you really mean, sir,\" **said** Peter, \"that extremely important **people** at the top of the political establishment **could** have committed serious crimes in their past, and no **one** knows about it?\"\"Nothing is more probable,\" **said** the Professor, taking off his spectacles and beginning to polish them, while he muttered to himself, \"I wonder what they do teach them at these schools.\" \"But what are we to do?\" **said** Susan. She felt that the conversation was beginning to get off the point.\"My dear young lady,\" **said** the Professor, suddenly looking up with a very sharp expression at both of them, \"there is **one** plan which no **one** has yet suggested and which is well worth trying.\" \"What's that?\" **said** Susan.\"We might all try voting blue in November,\" **said** he. And that was the end of that conversation.Winner: the Deep Magic from Before the Dawn of Time"

It was enough for her to feel.One half of the **world** cannot understand the pleasures of the other.Anything interests between those who love; and anything will serve as introduction to what is near the heart.There are **people**, who the more you do for them, the less they will do for themselves.But a sanguine temper, though for ever expecting more **good** than occurs, does not always pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression. It soon flies over the present failure, and begins to hope again.It is a great deal more natural than **one** **could** wish, that a young man, brought up by those who are proud, luxurious, and selfish, should be proud, luxurious, and selfish too.It is very unfair to judge of anybody's conduct without an intimate knowledge of their situation.There is **one** **thing**, Emma, which a man can always do, if he chooses, and that is, his duty; not by maneuvering and finessing, but by vigour and resolution.It was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted spirits.Something occurred while they were at Hartfield to **make** Emma **want** their advice; and, which was still more lucky, she wanted exactly the advice they gave.I **never** **could** have supposed it. But I love out of the **world**, and am often astonished at what I bear.Why did we wait for anything? Why not seize the pleasure at once? How often is happiness destroyed by preparation, foolish preparation?I am quite enough in love. I should be sorry to be more.For they **say** everyone is in love once in their lives, and I shall have been let off easily.There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart.I condition for nothing else; but, without music, life **would** be a blank to me.A vast deal may be done by those who dare to act.Seldom, very seldom does complete truth belong to any human disclosure; seldom can it happen that **something** is not a little disguised, or a little mistaken."

It just happened that I always liked lessons and books, and **could** remember **things** when I learned them. It just happened that I was born with a father who was beautiful and nice and clever, and **could** give me everything I liked. Perhaps I have not really a **good** temper at all, but if you have everything you **want** and everyone is kind to you, how can you help but be **good**-tempered? I don’t **know**’ – looking quite serious – ‘how shall I ever find out whether I am really a nice child or a horrid **one**. Perhaps I’m a hideous child, and no **one** will ever **know**, just because I **never** have any trials.’  ‘You are always supposing **things**,’ **said** Lavinia, and her air was very superior.‘I **know** I am,’ **said** Sara undisturbedly. ‘I **like** it. There is nothing so nice as supposing. It’s almost **like** being a fairy. If you suppose anything hard enough it seems as if it were real.’  ‘You are nicer than I am,’ **said** Sara. ‘I was too proud to try and **make** new friends. You **see**, now that trials have come, they have shown me that I am not a nice child. I was afraid they **would**. Perhaps’ – wrinkling her forehead wisely – ‘that is what they were sent for.’  ‘Sara,’ she **said**, ‘do you **think** you can bear living here?’Sara looked round also.‘If I pretend it’s quite different, I can,’ she answered.‘Or if I pretend it is a place in a story.’  When **people** are insulting you, there is nothing so **good** for them as not to **say** a word – just to look at them and **think**.  There’s nothing so strong as rage, except what makes you hold it in – that’s stronger. It’s a **good** **thing** not to answer your enemies.  [Sara watching a wonderful sunset from the rooftop]‘It’s a Splendid **one**,’ **said** Sara softly to herself. ‘It makes me feel almost afraid – as if **something** strange was just going to happen. The Splendid ones always **make** me feel **like** that.’   She looked at him interestedly for a second, and then smiled across the slates. She had learned to **know** how comforting a smile, **even** from a stranger, may be.  It **would** be easy to be a princess if I were dressed in cloth of gold, but it is a great deal more of a triumph to be **one** all the time when no **one** knows it.  ‘Perhaps you can feel if you can’t hear,’ was her fancy. ‘Perhaps kind thoughts reach **people** somehow, **even** through windows and doors and walls.’  Anyone who is kind wants to **know** when **people** have been made happy. They care for that more than for being thanked.  Perhaps there is a language which is not made of words and everything in the **world** understands it.  Perhaps to be able to learn **things** quickly isn't everything. To be kind is worth a great deal to other **people**...Lots of clever **people** have done harm and have been wicked"

And so is the hurt we cause others unknowingly. If only I’d understood then what I **know** now! He **said**. But how **could** he? There is so much we don’t understand. And so much unhappiness comes because of that. She **say**, Celie, tell the truth, have you ever found God in church? I **never** did. I just found a bunch of folks hoping for him to show. Any God I ever felt in church I brought in with me. And I **think** all the other folks did too. They come to church to share God, not find God. Here’s the **thing**, **say** Shug. The **thing** I believe. God is inside you and inside everybody else. You come into the **world** with God. But only them that search for it inside find it. And sometimes it just manifest itself **even** if you not looking, or don’t **know** what you looking for. Trouble do it for most folks, I **think**. Sorrow, lord. Feeling **like** shit. Oh, she **say**. God love all them feelings [sexual]. That’s some of the best stuff God did. And when you **know** God loves ‘em you enjoys ‘em a lot more. You can just relax, go with everything that’s going, and praise God by liking what you **like**.God don’t **think** it dirty? I ast.Naw, she **say**. God made it. Listen, God love everything you love – and a mess of stuff you don’t. But more than anything else, God love admiration.You saying God vain? I ast.Naw, she **say**. Not vain, just wanting to share a **good** **thing**. I **think** it pisses God off if you walk by the color purple in a field somewhere and don’t notice it.What it do when it pissed off? I ast.Oh, it **make** **something** else. People **think** pleasing God is all God care about. But any fool living in the **world** can **see** it always trying to please us back.Yeah? I **say**.Yeah, she **say**. It always making little surprises and springing them on us when us least expect.You mean it **want** to be loved, just **like** the bible **say**.Yes, Celie, she **say**. Everything **want** to be loved. Us sing and dance, **make** faces and give flower bouquets, trying to be loved. You ever notice trees do everything to git attention we do, except walk? God is different to us now, after all these years in Africa. More spirit than ever before, and more internal. Most **people** **think** he has to look **like** **something** or someone – a roofleaf or Christ – but we don’t. And not being tied to what God looks **like**, frees us. Just cause I love her don’t take away none of her rights I **think** us here to wonder, myself. To wonder. To ast. And that in wondering bout the big **things** and asting bout the big **things**, you learn about the little ones, almost by accident. But you **never** **know** nothing more about the big **things** than you start with. The more I wonder, he **say**, the more I love. If she come, I be happy. If she don’t, I be content.And then I figure this the lesson I was suppose to learn."

       "=)))“Atticus **said** to Jem **one** day, \"I’d rather you shot at tin cans in the backyard, but I **know** you’ll go after birds. Shoot all the blue jays you **want**, if you can hit ‘em, but remember it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.\" That was the only time I ever heard Atticus **say** it was a sin to do **something**, and I asked Miss Maudie about it. \"Your father’s right,\" she **said**. \"Mockingbirds don’t do **one** **thing** except **make** music for us to enjoy. They don’t eat up **people**’s gardens, don’t nest in corn cribs, they don’t do **one** **thing** but sing their hearts out for us. That’s why it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.”این کتاب از اوناییه که به نظرم واقعا پنج حقشونه. شاید اوایلش اصلا فکر نمی کردم بیشتر از سه بهش بدم، ولی الان حتی به همون قسمت های شروعش هم پنج می دم :) + خوندن کتاب خیلی زجر آور بود در کل::)))) خوندن داستان نه، ولی خوندن کتابی که عرضش اینقدر کوچیک بود که میانه های کتاب اصلا درست و حسابی باز نمی شد و با یه فونت کوچولو تا اون آخرش هم نوشته بودن، اذیت می کرد یکم. اونم من، که حتی وقت بود جداً و درست و حسابی کتاب دست نگرفته بودم و حسابی به ای بوک و تبلت عادت کردم :( در کل مواظب تبلت هاتون باشین که به عاقبت من دچار نشین =)) + ولی با این وجود، خیلی خوشحالم که یه انتشارات ( انتشارات جنگل ) کتابای زبان اصلی رو با این کیفیت و قیمت کاملاً مناسب چاپ می کنه.  + من تموم سعیم رو کردم که اسپویل نکنم، ولی اگه نخوندین، ترجیحاً این ریویو رو هم نخونین :)داستان اول شخص بود، به روایت یه دختر هشت ساله ( البته ماجراهای کتاب توی سه سال اتفاق افتادن. فکر می کنم اولش هفت سالش بود و آخر کتاب نه. ) به اسم جین لوییس فینج که اسکات صداش می کردن. اوایل یه کم برام عجیب بود یه دختر هفت-هشت ساله اینطوری حرف بزنه و رفتار کنه، ولی هر چی که جلوتر می رفت و با محیط زندگیش بیشتر آشنا می شدم، قابل درک تر می شد. اسکات یه دختره که خوشش نمیاد مثل خانم ها بشه و به نظر من، لجباز و مغروره. به همین دلیل هم هیچ وقت نمی بینیم که بگه که اتفاقات اطرافش رو درک نمی کنه، ولی همین حرف زدن و اظهار نظر کردن هاش کاملاً مشخص می کرد که هنوز خیلی بچه ست. شخصیت پردازی ها رو خیلی دوست داشتم. اسکات، برادرش جم ( جرمی )، پدرشون، همسایه ها و... خوب پردازش شده بودن. با اینکه شخصیتشون از دیدگاه یه دختر بچه روایت می شد که اصلا هم بی طرف نبود، ولی کاملا بهت اجازه می داد که خودت در موردشون قضاوت کنی. به شدت آتیکوس، پدر اسکات رو دوست داشتم. اخلاق و رفتار و حرف زدنش عالی بود. یه وکیل حدوداً پنجاه ساله، که به نظر من یه پدر خیلی خوب بود. تا حدوداً پنج فصل اول که اصلا به مکالمات محاوره ای شخصیت ها عادت نکرده بودم، آتیکوس تنها کسی بود که درست و حسابی حرف می زد و می شد حرف هاشو فهمید =)) خود شخصیتش هم کاملاً آدم رو جذب می کرد.“he did not do the **things** our schoolmates’ fathers did: he **never** went hunting, he did not play poker or fish, or drink or smoke. He sat in the living room and read.” آتیکوس نسبت به سن بچه هاش پیر محسوب می شه و اونا هم تا قبل از اینکه فهمیدن که پدرشون بهترین تیرانداز شهر بوده و اونو گذاشته کنار، همون تفکرات بالا رو نسبت بهش داشتن. ولی بعد که متوجه می شن، اتیکوس بهشون می گه: wanted you to **see** what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It's when you **know** you're licked before you begin, but you begin anyway and **see** it through no matter what.حرفاش... وای خدا حرفاش...“You **never** really understand a person until you consider **things** from his point of view... Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it.”من از قبل تقریباً می دونستم داستان چی هست، برای همین تا نصفه های کتاب فقط منتظر بودم داستان اون موکل آتیکوس پیش بیاد. ولی موضوع این بود که از نظر اسکات، داستان اصلی داستان پدرش نبود، داستان خودش و جم بود و ماجرای شکسته شدن دست جم.و برای همین هم اسکات هر جایی که خودش لازم می دونه برای تعریف داستان نیازه رو اضافه می کنه. این رو خیلی خیلی دوست داشتم و واقعاً هم لذت بردم. نویسنده کاری کرده بود که توی تمام کتاب این حس که راوی یه دختر بچه ست حس بشه و در عین حال، اون پیام زیبا رو داخلش بگنجونه. حتی یه جاهایی توی کتاب بود که اسکات شروع می کرد و به شکل تقریباً بی فایده ای از یه چیزای خاصی صحبت می کرد و توی همین صحنه ها هم، لحنش متفاوت بود. یه جا داشت صحبت های معلمش رو توضیح می داد و نسبتاً بی حوصله بود، یه جا داشت در مورد پدرش صحبت می کرد و هیجان زده بود و الی آخر. من این حس رو که یه بچه نشسته و داره این داستان رو برام تعریف می کنه رو توی کل داستان داشتم و خیلی برام خوشایند بود.یه بار دادگاه از آتیکوس می خواد که وکالت یه مرد سیاه پوست رو توی یه پرونده ی تجاوز بر عهده بگیره. خانواده ی دختر معتقدن که این مرد مجرمه و خودش هم انکار می کنه. جدا از نتیجه ی پرونده، همین نژاد پرستی مردم شهر و جبهه گرفتنشون علیه تام – همون متهم – و خانواده ی فینچ ها؛ و اتفاقاتی که به خاطر همین پرونده برای خانواده شون میوفته خیلی قشنگ و تاثیر گذاره. آتیکوس می گه که همیشه توی زندگی یه وکیل، یه پرونده هست که روی زندگیش تاثیر می ذاره و پرونده تام برای اون همین حکم رو داره. با اینکه مردم شهر مسخره ش می کنن و می گن عاشق سیاه پوست ها شده و حتی خواهر خودشم می گه کارش اشتباهه، می گه:“They're certainly entitled to **think** that, and they're entitled to full respect for their opinions... but before I can live with other folks I've got to live with myself. The **one** **thing** that doesn't abide by majority rule is a person's conscience.” یه جای کتاب هست که آتیکوس می گه این بی عدالتی ها هر روز اتفاق میوفته، و بعضی وقتا فقط بچه ها هستن که به خاطرش گریه می کنن. یا یه جای دیگه اسکات می گه یه روز شنیده معلمشون میگفته که این سیاه پوست ها خیلی دارن پررو می شن و باید یه درسی بهشون داد؛ دیگه همین کمه که بخوان با بچه ها مون ازدواج کنن و همین معلم یه جای دیگه سر کلاس به بچه ها می گه که از هیتلر متنفره، به خاطر اینکه یهودی ها رو فقط به خاطر اینکه با خودش هم اعتقاد نیستن کشته. اسکات این رو نمی فهمه و واقعا ًاز پدرش می پرسه چطور چنین چیزی ممکنه. در اون لحظه جداً می خواستم کتاب رو بذارم کنار و بشینم گریه کنم. علاوه بر این موضوع، داستان همون دختر شاکی هم هست که وقتی آتیکوس خانم صداش می زنه یا ازش می پرسه دوستی داری یا نه، دختره فکر می کنه مسخره ش کردن. زندگی دختر رو به تصویر می کشه و می ذاره خودت در مورد زندگیش تصمیم بگیری...فکر می کنم این کتاب یکی از بهترین کتابایی بود که خوندم، و فکر می کنم که بعداً هم خواهم خوندشون، و به هر کسی هم که بتونم توصیه خواهم کرد :)If there's just **one** kind of folks, why can't they get along with each other? If they're all alike, why do they go out of their **way** to despise each other? Scout, I **think** I'm beginning to understand **something**. I **think** I'm beginning to understand why Boo Radley's stayed shut up in the house all this time. It's because he wants to stay inside."

Alice follows a white rabbit down a rabbit hole and finds herself in a strange land. Nothing makes sense and everyone she encounters is odd. This is a fun book. It's silly and whimsical and doesn't **make** any sense. I don't remember ever reading this book as a child, but I definitely enjoyed it as an adult. Love the riddles, and it really is all rather curious.

       "I can spend hours quoting various parts of this book and yet I still will not be able to entirely prove the exquisiteness that is in book. This book is well-known enough that I **know** it needs no explanation about its story. Everyone must **know** by now about how it ends.   \"It often seems to me that art conceals the artist far more completely than it ever reveals him\" (Coincidentally, same is the case for writing     \"The artist is the creator of beautiful **things**.To reveal art and conceal the artist is art’s aim.The critic is he who can translate into another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful **things**.The highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography.Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful **things** are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault.Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful **things** are the cultivated. For these there is hope.They are the elect to whom beautiful **things** mean only Beauty.There is no such **thing** as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written. That is all\"    We can forgive a man for making a useful **thing** as long as he does not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless **thing** is that **one** admires it intensely.All art is quite useless  Oscar Wilde **never** seemed to me as a bitter person. Until I read Dorian Gray. Of course **people** will call me biased now for calling him cruel or stereotypical but that is the **way** I **think**. However, here is what differentiates Oscar from every other author out there; where every awful author makes sure to ridicule **people** and **make** you hate them for it, Oscar still manages to captivate you with his story and with his words despite spewing words that **would** have offended you if you had heard them from a person in this modern age. I **think** that is the point of his whole books and why English teachers rave on about his books in their classes. He has changed the point of reading entirely for me from now on. I cannot **think** the same **way**. I cannot **even** **make** choices the same **way** anymore either.  Because to influence a person is to give him **one**’s own soul.   The **one** **thing** that struck me the most in his book was his justification for the use of drugs, alcohol and other means to forget memories. Dorian uses opium to forget the crime he commits and he is reminded of what Sir Henry **said** to him \"....that is **one** of the great secrets of life – to cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of the soul\".   And this made me wonder if that was the key I had been missing all along. If all I needed was to cure my soul using my senses. That is the magic of this book; it makes you contemplate **things** in ways you have **never** imagined before.  Behind every exquisite **thing** that existed, there was **something** tragic   My favorite quotes from the entire book were:  The only **things** **one** **never** regrets are **one**’s mistakes    People are very fond of giving away what they need most themselvesHe lives the poetry that he cannot write. The others write the poetry that they dare not realizeIt is **said** that passion makes **one** **think** in a circleThere are moments, psychologists tell us, when the passion for sin, or for what the **world** calls sin, so dominates a nature, that every fibre of the body, as every cell of the brain, seems to be instinct with fearful impulsesThe **things** **one** feels absolutely certain about are **never** trueThe books that the **world** calls immoral are books that show the **world** its own shameBut then **one** regrets the loss **even** of **one**’s worst habits\"The secret of life is to reproduce that experience as often as possible.’‘Even when **one** has been wounded by it, Harry?’ asked the Duchess, after a pause.‘Especially when **one** has been wounded by it,’ answered Lord Henry.     There were moments when he looked on evil simply as a mode through which he **could** realize his conception of the beautiful.  "

       "Sorry, call me everything that's wrong with men today but I did not **like** this book. I felt that Virginia Woolf, though justified in the idea that women needed more equality in being accepted to libraries and colleges, is still searching for what will **never** bring happiness. If we truly abandon everything that makes us male and female for some androgynous ideal that we'll be unhappy, besides being impossible anyhow. There is a great wrong that's been done to women through the ages, they **never** received acknowledgment for the labor they performed and the societies they created and I agree that almost all the blame lies on men. I find it frustrating that so many **people** feel the solution lies with \"equality\" in some strange universe maybe, where **people** can somehow change genders at will or where there is no difference between them. I will always agree with my friend who quoted I don't **know** who when she **said**, \"until homemaking can be seen as an honorable profession equality cannot be achieved\". So go ahead Virginia Woolf, yell out whatever injustices you **want**, I agree with so many of them it makes me sick to **think** of what men have done against women through the ages, but the idea that by giving up what makes us men and women will **make** us happy is absurd."

These **people** go to a 'wizard' to grant their wish, from which they all get placebos. The placebos **make** these characters believe that their 'prayers' have been answered, so to speak. In reality, we have the power to fulfill our own requests. This is just the surface; there are also little details that draw me to this conclusion, but this is just a review--no need to prove my claim.Anyways, I really **like** the poppy field scene. Taking in too much of the beautiful smell will knock a person out forever--unless someone pulls them out and revives them. This seems to symbolize **things** such as drugs and alcohol (to me).

'With you, if you will ask me.' 'Will you?' **said** he, offering his hand. 'Why yes! We are not so much brother and sister as to **make** it improper.' 'Brother and sister! No indeed!' \"\"I always deserve the best treatment because I **never** put up with any other.\"\"Wickedness is always wickedness but folly is not always folly.\"\"My dearest Emma,\" **said** he, \"for dearest you will always be, whatever the event of this hour's conversation, my dearest, most beloved Emma -- tell me at once. Say 'No,' if it is to be **said**.\" She **could** really **say** nothing. \"You are silent,\" he cried, with great animation; \"absolutely silent! at present I ask no more.\"Emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment. The dread of being awakened from the happiest dream, was perhaps the most prominent feeling.\"I cannot **make** speeches, Emma,\" he soon resumed; and in a tone of such sincere, decided, intelligible tenderness as was tolerably convincing. \"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you **know** what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me. I have blamed you, and lectured you, and you have borne it as no other woman in England **would** have borne it. Bear with the truths I **would** tell you now, dearest Emma, as well as you have borne with them. The manner, perhaps, may have as little to recommend them. God knows, I have been a very indifferent lover. But you understand me. Yes, you **see**, you understand my feelings and will return them if you can. At present, I ask only to hear, once to hear your voice.\" \"This sweetest and best of all creatures, faultless in spite of all her faults.\"\"What had she to wish for? Nothing, but to grow more worthy of him, whose intentions and judgement had been ever so superior to her own. Nothing but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in the future.\" Emma and Knightley <3 "

       "I really disliked this book. I dislike it in the **way** that I dislike a great deal of modern self help books. Their basic message is that if you **want** **something** to happen, you need to **want** it as hard as you can, without caring about anything else, not allowing yourself to doubt it, or let criticisms will get in the **way** then it will happen.I disagree with this notion, not only because it is false, but because it is bad.Just because we desire **something**, does not **make** it **good**. This idea of 'following your heart' is often wrong. Who are we to be the arbiters of truth? Why should our hearts be sources of information that go beyond logic, doubt and reasoning? Haven't we all desired **things** that have turned out to not be in our best interest, or to be harmful to others? Andrew Jackson was a man known to have a lot of integrity. He was always 'true' to himself and followed his heart. Andrew Jackson is the man who initiated the 'Trail of Tears'. Moving Native Americans from their homes and into reservations. Next, this idea of not letting ourselves doubt or consider doubts. This is a terrible and dishonest **way** to live. If we don't consider doubts, and entertain them often, then we are deliberately blinding ourselves. Deliberately making ourselves ignorant. If someone doesn't give serious consideration to the idea that they may be wrong. Give serious thought to why they believe what they do, and that perhaps those who doubt them may be correct, then they are behaving in a dangerous and dishonest **way**.Not giving heed to the concerns doubts and criticisms of others is **something** I believe is a major fault in modern society. Often, **people** fail to recognize the needs of the group and the community. We place so much emphasis on the needs and rights of the individual. This causes **people** to focus so much on themselves to the detriment of others around them. At times, it can be beneficial to go against the group, but **one** should first give serious consideration to the groups concerns.According to Ideas **like** the Alchemist, groups **like**, the Westboro Baptist Church,(godhatesfags.com) should be seen as American heroes. These are **people** who take a totally irrational stance, and stick to it as hard as they can in complete defiance to the views of everyone around them."

The descriptions are beautiful. Though Sara seemed a little too perfect sometimes, she really is a lovely little soul. I wanted her to have a happy ending which she eventually did. All in all, A Little Princess by Frances Hodgson Burnett touched my heart.Quotes:“Perhaps to be able to learn **things** quickly isn't everything. To be kind is worth a great deal to other **people**...Lots of clever **people** have done harm and have been wicked.” “I am a princess. All girls are. Even if they live in tiny old attics. Even if they dress in rags, **even** if they aren't pretty, or smart, or young. They’re still princesses.” “Somehow, **something** always happens just before **things** get to the very worst. It is as if Magic did it. If I **could** only just remember that always. The worse **thing** **never** quite comes.” “I don't **know** who it is,\" she **said**; \"but somebody cares for me a little. I have a friend.” Lessons Learnt:The **world** is full of magic. You just have to wait for it to happen to you. The most important **thing** isn't to be the most intelligent nor the most beautiful person. The most important **thing** in life is to be a **good** person. A person who is kind and generous. A person who has a **good** heart.Even if **one** is miserable and feels **like** there is no **one** to help them, there is always someone who cares. There is always someone who is a friend.Everyone is special no matter where they come from. No matter where they are going.At a moment where all seems dark, where there is no **way** out, there will be magic. The magic that makes **things** better. The magic that doesn't let the worst **thing** happen. One must always remember that."

How can **something** be so logical, yet so nonsensical at the same time?2. The poems - Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is full of poetry.

So bright, and curious, and witty, and a bit precocious, actually, but I kind of **like** that. 4. Only in this book **could** you have a mouse delivering history lessons, a baby morphing into a piglet, and flamingos as croquet mallets, and have it somehow **make** perfect sense. 5.

My friend Nata suggested this book to me, and **even** though I am only fourteen, I feel **like** I just appreciated life a bit more than ever before. Everyone in this **world** will die, and who knows what happens next, so I learnt that its now or **never** to do **something** **good** and **make** yourself happy. I will always keep this quote in mind: \"Once you learn how to die, you learn how to live\". One of the **things** I learnt about this quote is that **people** don't accept that **one** day we will be here and the next, gone. Once they do realize it though, its really to late because most of their life is already gone at old age. I'm sorry that this review doesn't contain **good** grammar and writing, but I am writing from my heart about how much I have learnt from this book because it had really touched me. "

Why, she **said**, the mother of his children. But I am not the mother of anybody's children, I **said**, and I am **something**. You are not much, she **said**.

Why do they **say** I will be a wife of the chief? asks Olivia. That is as high as they can **think**, I tell her. p. 157Anyhow, I **say**, the God I been praying and writing to is a man. And act just **like** all the other mens I **know**. Trifling, forgitful and lowdown. p. 192You telling me God love you, and you ain't **never** done nothing for him? I mean, not go to church, sing in the choir, feed the preacher and all **like** that? But if God love me, Celie, I don't have to do all that. Unless I **want** to. There's a lot of other **things** I can do that I spec God likes. Like what? I ast. Oh, she **say**. I can lay back and just admire stuff. Be happy. Have a **good** time. Well, this sound **like** blasphemy sure nuff. She **say**, Celie, tell the truth, have you ever found God in church? I **never** did. I just found a bunch of folks hoping for him to show. Any God I ever felt in church I brought in with me. And I **think** all the other folks did too. They come to church to share God, not find God. p. 193God love all them feelings. That's some of the best stuff God did. And when you **know** God loves 'em you enjoys 'em a lot more. You can just relax, go with everything that's going, and praise God by liking what you **like**. p. 196I **think** it pisses God off if you walk by the color purple in a field somewhere and don't notice it. p. 196People **think** pleasing God is all God care about. But any fool living in the **world** can **see** it always trying to please us back. p. 196You have to git man off your eyeball, before you can **see** anything a'tall. Man corrupt everything, **say** Shug. He on your box of grits, in your head, and all over the radio. He try to **make** you **think** he everywhere. Soon as you **think** he everywhere, you **think** he God. But he ain't. Whenever you trying to pray, and man plop himself on the other end of it, tell him to git lost, **say** Shug. Conjure up flowers, wind, water, a big rock. p. 197He laugh. Who you **think** you is? he **say**. You can't curse nobody. Look at you. You black, you pore, you ugly, you a woman. Goddam, he **say**, you nothing at all. p. 206It didn't take long to realize I didn't hardly **know** nothing. And that if you ast yourself why you black or a man or a woman or a bush it don't mean nothing if you don't ask why you here, period. So what you **think**? I ask. I **think** us here to wonder, myself. To wonder. To ask. And that in wondering bout the big **things** and asking bout the big **things**, you learn about the little ones, almost by accident. But you **never** **know** nothing more about the big **things** than you start out with. The more I wonder, she **say**, the more I love. p. 282I took six months reading this book because it was on my phone, and that's not how I usually read. The writing was beautiful and the story depressing but hopeful. A great book for women. Lots of **good** quotes."

That's the **world**'s greatest lie.\" \"...when you **want** **something**, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.\"\"His **way** is not the same as mine, nor mine as his. But we're both in search of our destinies, and I respect him for that.\"\"Because **people** become fascinated with pictures and words, and wind up forgetting the Language of the World.\"\"The day after we met, Fatima **said**, you told me that you loved me. Then, you taught me **something** of the universal language and the Soul of the World. Because of that, I have become a part of you.\"\"How do I guess the future? Based on the omens of the present. The secret is here in the present. If you pay attention to the present, you can improve upon it. And, if you improve on the present, what comes later will also be better. Forget the future, and live each day according to the teachings, confident that God loves his children. Each day, in itself, brings with it an eternity.\" \"Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than suffering itself. And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a second's encounter with God and with eternity.\"\"Don't give into your fears, **said** the alchemist, in a strangely gentle voice, If you do, you won't be able to talk to your heart.\"\"If a person is living out his destiny, he knows everything he needs to **know**. There is only **one** **thing** that makes a dream impossible to achieve: fear of failure.\"\"Love is the force that transforms and improves the Soul of the World.\" "

It's one of those pieces of literature that you need to come back to every few years to enjoy again. While I understood Tolstoy's discussion of the philosophy of history within the novel, I thought the epilogues, particularly the second epilogue, were just too **much**.As to the **translation**, I did not like the fact that they left the \"French\" in the **text** and translated it in footnotes at the bottom. That plus the explanatory notes made for too **much** jumping around in the book and broke the flow of the story. Read about half on Kindle."

Shakespeare's diction is so profoundly poetic and idiomatic that it might be thought untranslatable, even when it is rendered into **modern** English idiom, it loses its antique beauty when tampered with, like those monuments reconstructed from history that look like originals but actually are not.And so **reading** Shakespeare in Urdu was always going to be a fascinating experience. I commend Firaq Gorakhpuri's consummate skill in recreating Hamlet in an idiom that recalls the dying days of the classical dialect mixed in with sufficient modernist invention to keep it coherent, but without employing too **many** calques and direct borrowings which **would** have grated on my nerves. I **also** like that the translator did not depart from the prose-poetry form of the **original**. All in all, this **translation** of Hamlet may go down as one of the finest examples of how to translate classical English literature, and not just Shakespeare, in a **language** that is fast losing translations from other cultures.December '16"

I've done that twice with two different professors (Carol Pasternack as an undergrad, Nick Howe, the editor of this **translation**, as a grad). This **translation** is Donaldson's and is in prose, which loses some of the effect, but preserves a lot of the phrases more faithfully than, say, Seamus Heaney's **translation**. You may not get the effect of the alliteration, but the appositive style is more faithful to the **original** (and there is an essay on the importance of appositive style in Beowulf included in the book). The last half of the book is a series of articles on the poem, one introductory and the others critical. Some may be harder to **understand**, but any college student should be able to find several which are accessible enough for them. My favorites are John Niles' and Roberta Frank's. "

It probably helped that Heaney is a distinguished poet in his own right; his **translation** was fluid, with a rhythm and tone somewhere between Homer and Tolkien in feel. And the story is fun, a Pagan tale set mostly in Dark Ages Denmark with Christian interjections by the **original** poet who probably was a monk writing anywhere between the mid-seventh to the end of the tenth century. There are monsters, notably Grendel and a dragon with his horde. What's not to love?And a **translation** is needed. I **read** a bilingual **edition**, with the **original** Old English (Anglo-Saxon) and **modern** English **translation** side by side. Knowing Spanish I often can make out the gist of passages in Portuguese, Italian or even French.

There were several times, especially with some of the sexual innuendo, that I decided to compare the Folger notes to the Arden ones and realized that Folger didn't footnote those passages at all. I didn't realize that the Folger notes were that lacking.But, at the same **time**, the mountain of notes that the Arden provides is overwhelming at times. It makes for a really claustrophobic page. Not only are there great notes on the meaning of the passages, but there's **also** footnotes with the editor defending his editorial choices, line by line criticism, possible textual sources for various phrases/idioms, even just the editor griping about how lacking he finds the scholarship of other well known Shakespeare editors. It was amusing at times, but at other times it felt more like **reading** a 600 page book ABOUT Hamlet rather than **reading** the play itself. Overall, I think I really learned a lot and noticed a few things that I hadn't noticed before - in part because of the excellent notes, but **also** just because of the slower pace it took to **read** the massive amounts of notes. So, I think the next **time** I go to **read** Othello or Macbeth or even just Much Ado About Nothing, I'll seek out an Arden **edition**, but for brand-new-to-me plays, I'm going to stick with my tried & true Folger editions just so I can experience the play on its own merits before getting swamped with other people's opinions of what's going on."

While the simplicity of the **text** may be off-putting at **first** (to those of us, who - like me - think that all translations of classical works have to be a pretentious type of elegant), it works so, so well in the context of the poem. Emily Wilson's writing is crisp and clear, bold where it needs to be, and it has such amazing imagery too. It flows really nicely, and it's easy to **read**, which I think is very important, especially in a **translation**. A side note: it's worthwhile to **read** the introduction and the translator's note. If you've never **read** The Odyssey before, or don't know **much** about it, there is some information in there that can really add to the **text** when you **read** it.

I decided on a prose **version** because I really just wanted to know the stories, and if I'm **reading** a **translation** anyway, I might as well **read** it in prose form. As Wright points out in his introduction, it can be difficult to translate poetry while trying to maintain the poem, creating difficulties for the reader. One thing I found interesting was that for two of the tales, Wright simply gives the reader the gist of it, and does not bother including them in the book. He seems to feel that, even translated, these pieces are unnecessarily long-winded and unwieldy, and we **would** be better off without them. These are \"The Tale of Melibeus\" and \"The Parson's Tale\".I was so surprised by the vulgarity, sex, and humor that were present in these tales. It was fascinating how the tales swung back and forth between morality stories about the saints and stories about wayward wives and their sexual exploits. I found some of the stories very very funny, which was another surprise. It's fantastic that even though this was written over 600 years ago, we still can find so **many** points of commonality. Of course, our views of women have changed (for the most part), and the overall culture's views towards God and the Church are different, but these details only make the tales more intriguing. I think it is truly incredible that we have this opportunity to **read** stories that give us a glimpse of what life was like centuries ago. And it is so **much** fun to **read**. Really, this is a very highly recommended **translation** for anyone who is considering **reading** The Canterbury Tales."

But the above having been said, The Annotated Anne of Green Gables still is in all ways a true treasure and pleasure, not only providing detailed annotations to and for the **text**, to and for L.M. Montgomery's glorious and evocative story of Anne Shirley arriving in Avonlea and becoming Marilla and Mathew Cuthbert's Anne of Green Gables but **also** including **much** supplemental details and enlightening analyses on such diverse and interesting topics as historical information on orphans in Canada and the PEI school system during the 19th and early 20th centuries, with the extensive bibliography being the cowning glory, the delicious and **much** appreciated icing on the cake (which could all of course **also** easily be skipped if one is either not that interested or only wants to peruse the actual **text** and check the annotations as and when they appear, but the supplemental details and bibliographical lists are present and easily accessible and available to and for those of us who do and might desire and require them). Most highly recommend, and an absolute must for serious L.M. Montgomery and Anne of Green Gables fans and/or scholars (and it is, in my humble opinion, **also** truly both unfortunate and sadly frustrating that so far, only the **first** book of the Anne of Green Gables series has been annotated, as the remaining seven novels **also** could **much** do with and benefit from having similarly detailed annotations provided and presented, in particular since L.M. Montgomery often peppered her novels with literary allusions)."

The Tolkien direct **translation** is more 'difficult,' but both (I cannot verify, but I got the feeling) more accurate and more lovely to the ear, with evocative and musical **language**. Tolkien's **language** and imagery is both vivid and elevated; and gives the reader the feeling of a glimpse into the past.Heaney apparently admitted that he sacrificed literal accuracy to his desire to keep the poem a poem - to maintain a certain 'alliteration and rhythm.' He **also** gives the story a far more **modern**-sounding vocabulary; which some may prefer - but I did not.For me, the Heaney lies between two of Tolkien's versions. Tolkien did his accurate, scholarly **translation**. But he **also** wrote his own poem or 'lay' based on Beowulf - which is true, musical poetry. Both **work** amazingly at being the best possible iteration of what they are. A faithful **translation**. A heart-moving poem. Heaney's **translation** - while it is undoubtedly better than **many** others - is sometimes awkward rather than gloriously archaic. Still; had I not **read** the other **version** directly preceding it, I probably **would**'ve given 5 stars. "

I **read** the **translation** available on Project Gutenberg by Pope from the late 1700s, so maybe there are more **modern** (and possibly more faithful) translations.Even so, I really enjoyed my journey with the Iliad. Four-hundred and fifty pages of Iambic Pentameter and rhyming couplets took some serious getting used to but once I had I could really FEEL how this story was passed down for thousands of years **first** from mouth-to-mouth and then in print. It really is an epic.Though that said I had some gripes with the story, a number of which may be due to the **translation** more than the story. My **first** and largest issue is names! This **translation** has chosen to use what I assume to be the roman names for each of the gods (Jove/Neptune/Ulysses rather than what I **understand** to be the greek Zeus/Poseidon/Odysseus) which made referencing the names a little difficult. Another issue I had with naming is when a character is called by multiple names, this included the major hero Achilles (aka Pelides)! This issue is then compounded when a single name is sometimes used for multiple characters (Atrides is used to reference both Menelaus and Agamemnon). This took me quite a while to get to grips with especially when accounting for my second issue: I often found it difficult to keep track of what was going on and who was talking. This is likely attributable to my lack of experience **reading** epic poetry, as I progressed through the story I found myself better understanding what was happening. This was often with assistance from the translators footnotes that reference other works and note things to pay attention to over the coming pages.Overall I really enjoyed the Iliad, I'll likely seek out and **read** a more **modern** **translation** in the future to see if my issues are alleviated through someone else's lens on the story."

       "This might be not only the worst **translation** of Chaucer, but the worst **translation** of anything ever written.First of all, there shouldn't be translations of Chaucer. Much of Chaucer's meaning comes through the **language** he uses. Take away the **language**, and what's left is no longer Chaucer. I can see an argument for translating Chaucer into German, French, Italian, Tagalog, whatever. But into Modern English--that's insulting.If you can't **read** Chaucer's Middle English, just skip The Canterbury Tales. If you really REALLY want to **read** it, struggle with the Middle English for about an hour. After that, you'll be fine. I'd highly recommend either the Riverside Chaucer (complete works in a scholarly **edition**) or the Norton Critical **text** of the Tales, which has marginal glosses and footnotes to explain the meanings of **words** and provide historical information.It's frustrating, though, when a **translation** is so far from the **original** meaning of the **text** that it seems the translator is really writing his or her own poem. This was what was frustrating about Seamus Heaney's **translation** of Beowulf and Simon Armitage's of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. Here, though, there was at least some system in place, an overriding philosophy dictating the changes each translator made to his **text**. Raffel seems to just delight in misleading the reader. Take the opening lines. Chaucer wrote, \"Whan that Aprill with his shoures soote, / The droughte of March hath perced to the roote.\" Famous lines. Raffel's rendering: \"When April arrives, and with his sweetned showers / Drenches dried-up roots, gives them power.\" No mention of March; \"dried-up\" hardly conveys the same sense as \"drought.\" Later on, Raffel describes the Squire as having \"ridden with his father, on cavalry raids / In Flanders, Artois, and Picardy.\" Chaucer does not say that the Squire rode with his father, the Knight, on any campaigns at all. In fact, the battles fought by the Knight and Squire contrast--where the Knight had ridden on Crusades, the Squire had taken part in the Hundred Years' War. This important piece of characterization is entirely omitted in Raffel's **translation**.Anything worth doing is worth taking **time** over. Chaucer's **language** is worth learning. This type of short-cut is a travesty. If you're **reading** it for pleasure, be aware that you're NOT **reading** Chaucer; if you're **reading** it in class, transfer to another class--your professor doesn't know what he's doing."

This is in large part thanks to the kind of **language** Emily Wilson uses. In her introduction she explains that other translations often use some sort of old fanshioned English. Which makes **reading** the book unnecessarily complicated. The story itself is very old, filled with customs and ideas that are hard to **understand** for a **modern** western person like myself, there is no need to make it even harder by using some sort of English that people spoke 50 years ago. Another reason I think this book reads so well is because Emily Wilson is a woman. She explains in her introduction that this is definitely of influence on the end result. While it is impossible to turn the Odyssey into a feminist manifesto — it will forever be a barbaric tale of a horrible brute — it is definitely possible to choose more positive descriptions of the women in the book when in doubt. I’m very happy that I kept falling asleep during all my previous attempts to **read** the Odyssey, otherwise I wouldn’t have **read** this great **translation** by Emily Wilson. And I wouldn’t have **read** the introduction which is an excellent lecture about how Homer and the Odyssey were perceived throughout the centuries, and which places the story in a **modern** day western context. A true eye opener."
