While this trend has made me upset because the feature I could not control and was teased for my entire life is now being considered sexy when non asian girls do it, I realize I don’t have much control over things like this so I just ignore it.\n",

I then   in the heat of the moment dmed B saying “no, you don’t look like bella hadid, you look like the racist you are.. but like.. chic!”. She read the message, said “what the fuck..?”, and took down the post (I should make it clear that there were some comments NOT FROM ME on her post about the fox eye thing being problematic.

So, a few days ago my cousin (48M) and his wife (31F) came to stay with me because their ac broke down and they were having trouble finding someone to fix it immediately(we live in a very hot country and they dont have ceiling fans).

I put the kid in my fiance's son's room, the couple in mine, and I moved into fiance's room like usual They went all quiet when I showed them the room, but I didnt really think anything of it. Later, cousin knocked on my door and asked to switch rooms because they werent comfortable sleeping separately. \n",

First he got offended and said he was too well behaved to touch anything (He's not. Hes broken my stuff before) ,then asked if I could move the queen into the other room. I said, ok fine we'll see about that tomorrow but no no no, it had to be tonight. Well, it was late and there was no way but he thought that it would only take me a couple of hours. I said,' wait, you're helping right?'  but he said it was rude to ask a guest to fix something that was a result of my own 'lack of forethought'. \n",
      "\n",
      "I just closed the door on him and went to sleep. Next morning, the wife was irritable through breakfast ( she tossed all the uncooked stuff I'd left out into the trash without even asking me- including half a loaf of fresh homemade brioche ) and I could hear them having whispered arguments.

      "I (19f) live with my parents. My older brother (25) moved back in at the beginning of the current event. My brother is an alcoholic, and he has epilepsy. His doctors have told him he should not drink at all, as alcohol will trigger his seizures because of the medication (I'm not sure on the specifics but basically, he is not supposed to drink). When he takes his medication properly and doesn't drink, he rarely has seizures and can always sense them coming, and because of this, he is allowed to drive. Nobody advises that he does drive, though.\n",

      "I live in the UK, and I passed my driving test last December. I bought myself a little car with my student loan, and I insure it on my own.

When my brother came back from the store, he had a seizure as he was coming down our street, and he swerved into the back of my car.\n",

Not only has he caused a lot of expensive damage to my car, as I am a new driver, when I report this to my insurance it will make my insurance cost for next year absolutely skyrocket and I probably won't be able to afford it. My parents were also mad at him, as he admitted he felt that he would have a seizure soon when he was in the store but he thought he would be able to manage the 5 minute drive home. It also came out that he had consumed 6 bottles of cider last night.\n",
      "\n",
      "To me, this is disgusting and he absolutely knew the risks. I demanded he pay for the damages at least, and he should also pay the difference between what my insurance should be in the next years and what it is, until my insurance is manageable. I will use a comparison site to figure out what my insurance should be for next year if I had no claims, vs what it will be after my claim, and I expect him to pay the difference. My parents think I'm being ridiculous because my brother doesn't work and is on benefits, but I don't care, because I worked so hard to get and insure my own car, which he damaged after knowingly increasing the risk of seizures dramatically. AITA?\n",

We were having a rough patch in our relationship at that time because of the stress of being unable to conceive, so I tried to understand him and gave our relationship another chance. I was gutted when he later told me that Madison was pregnant, but what’s done was done and the only thing I could do was accept it. They now have a son, Kit.

Beside Karla is her husband and in front of them are their two kids. To their right is me, beside me is Kyle, and beside Kyle is Madison. Kit is in front of Kyle. My heart sank when I saw Madison. I have nothing against Kit being in the picture and I know that they my in laws are close to Madison too, but to have her in the portrait with Kyle between me and her… that just broke my heart.\n",

My MIL apologized for hurting my feelings but said that they didn’t mean to upset me, they were just thinking of Kit and how they don’t want him to feel that her mother isn’t family to them.

She said that I should learn to live with the fact that Madison will always be there as long as I’m married to Kyle because of Kit.

      "My boyfriend runs a small food business, has done for the last few years. I have my own job but since he's begin cooking professionally, I have always been involved. From helping with menus, doing his finances and packaging orders for delivery etc, I have always felt like it was partly mine. I have always assumed he saw it the same way as it's never been \"hey, can you help me with this\" but rather \"you need to do this today for me\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Although I have put some of my own money in this business, I never expected to be an equal partner but as I spend around 20 hours a week doing work for him, some credit would be nice. Up until recently, he would usually say \"we\" in most social media posts and I assumed that was both of us. It is really all the credit I needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other day, he made an Instagram business post which was partly about how difficult it is to operate right now and (paraphrasing) said it was particularly difficult for him as he was doing this totally by himself. As usual, I proof read his post. I was pretty hurt to see the line about not having any help and I did bring it up. He said that it was better for the business if it looked like it was all him. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A few hours later, he asked me to package up some orders for shipping. I retorted that he should do it himself if it's better for business. I was partly joking but he was furious in his reaction and I've now told him I won't do anything for him. \n",
      "\n",
      "He's now trying to fill in some forms (something I normally handle) and struggling. The one friend I've told thinks I should help him as it's not like I want a public declaration of my existence and this is a stupid fight. I think that if my work isn't being rewarded with cash, some basic respect would work well too. I also think it might be worth him learning how difficult yet mind numbingly boring some of the work I do for him is.\n",

      "✨Text✨\n",
      "For starters she’s 39 weeks, she’s literally about to pop. She also got the dog without consulting me, it was literally a spur of the moment thing with her, and not one time did I bitch about it, or trip. He’s the loveliest Golden Lab mix with green eyes. I will say he’s a handful, and though our apartment is spacious, it’s only but so big. I feel like he sleeps most of the time, but when he’s in play mode, he can be a bit much. \n",
      "\n",
      "I pretty much chalk it down to the lack of special attention, obviously she’s pregnant so the urge to take him out and walk him on a consistent basis while I’m at work is rather non existent. I’m not saying she doesn’t at all, but I feel like a properly trained dog is gonna behave and adhere to house rules. I take him out at least twice a day, and to the park at least twice a week, though I’m well aware that he should be at the park more. \n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly I just feel like she’s missing the principle. She took on the responsibility, and now she’s “overwhelmed”. She even laughed when her sister in law suggested we put him on the side of the road at her sister’s mother day dinner... Not to mention she rushed into finalizing to move into our current apartment which she low key hates. She’s a serial offender when it comes to this type of stuff. \n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, I feel like I compromise with literally everything, whenever her 4 nieces and nephew want to come over I might bitch, but I give in. I give in to whatever she wants to eat, whatever she wants to drink, when we order food, I pay all the bills and utilities, I pay whenever she needs her hair done, etc... She literally has zero responsibilities. She hardly cooks, or cleans, and I get it she’s pregnant. \n",
      "\n",
      "I just feel as though, she can be a really selfish person at times, but this time she’s gone too far. I’ve invested financially and emotionally into the dog, and we haven’t even had him a full month. She gave me an ultimatum, which is “Me or the dog”, and I responded no, “it’s me and Cujo or nothing”. She also named him Cujo. I could be wrong in this entire situation, but I’m not budging.\n",

This one girl, we’ll call her B, bullied me relentlessly in high school and would make fun of my eyes (she would pull her eyes back when she saw me), call me Ling Ling, chink, ask me if Kim Jong Un was my dad, tell me to stop eating dogs, etc. All unprovoked, and I never said anything back because my Korean parents always told me to swallow my pride and take it.

She’s trying super hard to be an “influencer”, and there has been this trend going around called the “fox eye trend” where girls will pull their eyes back just like they would when they mock asian eyes in the attempts to look more “chic”. While this trend has made me upset because the feature I could not control and was teased for my entire life is now being considered sexy when non asian girls do it, I realize I don’t have much control over things like this so I just ignore it.\n",

I saw the post because my friend, who was always there to listen to me when I was hurt by B, sent it to me, and we had talked about the fox eye trend a couple days ago. I then   in the heat of the moment dmed B saying “no, you don’t look like bella hadid, you look like the racist you are.. but like.. chic!”. She read the message, said “what the fuck..?”, and took down the post (I should make it clear that there were some comments NOT FROM ME on her post about the fox eye thing being problematic.

      "✨Text✨\n",
      "I (19f) live with my parents. My older brother (25) moved back in at the beginning of the current event. My brother is an alcoholic, and he has epilepsy. His doctors have told him he should not drink at all, as alcohol will trigger his seizures because of the medication (I'm not sure on the specifics but basically, he is not supposed to drink). When he takes his medication properly and doesn't drink, he rarely has seizures and can always sense them coming, and because of this, he is allowed to drive. Nobody advises that he does drive, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "I live in the UK, and I passed my driving test last December. I bought myself a little car with my student loan, and I insure it on my own. My insurance is 1.5k a year, the car was 1k, and my income for the year is 7k as I'm at uni and I only have my student loan. I pay my parents rent, around 1k for the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "My brother recently went to the store for our family shop. The store is about a five minute drive from our house. Nobody is happy about him driving for the family shop, but my car is too small to carry all of the shopping. My parents don't drive. When my brother came back from the store, he had a seizure as he was coming down our street, and he swerved into the back of my car.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was absolutely furious. Not only has he caused a lot of expensive damage to my car, as I am a new driver, when I report this to my insurance it will make my insurance cost for next year absolutely skyrocket and I probably won't be able to afford it. My parents were also mad at him, as he admitted he felt that he would have a seizure soon when he was in the store but he thought he would be able to manage the 5 minute drive home. It also came out that he had consumed 6 bottles of cider last night.\n",
      "\n",
      "To me, this is disgusting and he absolutely knew the risks. I demanded he pay for the damages at least, and he should also pay the difference between what my insurance should be in the next years and what it is, until my insurance is manageable. I will use a comparison site to figure out what my insurance should be for next year if I had no claims, vs what it will be after my claim, and I expect him to pay the difference. My parents think I'm being ridiculous because my brother doesn't work and is on benefits, but I don't care, because I worked so hard to get and insure my own car, which he damaged after knowingly increasing the risk of seizures dramatically. AITA?\n",
      "\n",
      "EDIT: just to let you guys who aren't from the UK know, if you get into an accident THAT IS NOT YOUR FAULT in the UK, your insurance will probably go up. Even if it's not your fault. It will increase even more if it is your fault, but any accidents will increase the premium. Especially when you're a new driver. \n",

He even got to go on a first date but his date literally got up and left after about a half hour. \n",

      "I know exactly the reason why and it’s not flattering. For one thing my parents coddled him since he was a kid because he was on the spectrum and was the only boy in our family. My mom in particular always told him he was smarter and more advanced than everyone else who’s neurotypical. This has led to his belief today that he genuinely is smarter than everyone else, especially women who he thinks are inherently irrational, illogical people. \n",

He tends to say very hurtful things first and when we get upset, he will then say things like “you are being irrational/hysterical/illogical, I’m just being honest and you can’t accept it.” This is like his catch phrase over the years and drives us absolutely INSANE. \n",

He said he is now sure that he feels romantic feelings for men, and also told her he has been sleeping with random men from Grindr for over a year behind her back. She obviously freaked out, asked him how he could do this, why didn't he tell her when he started having the feelings, etc. He said that he's always thought he was gay but he didn't want to come out because it might affect his career. She asked him what about the effect on her life? She is now a single mother to two toddlers. He was essentially very angry that she wasn't supportive of this, so he kicked her out of the house, with the kids. After she eventually found a place to stay, my brother moved in one of the men he has been having an affair with. \n",

I told him I get that you have to come out in your own time, but you don't need to kick her out, ignore your kids and berate her, and you don't need to make comments that people will assume mean she was being unfaithful (he said this was a joke about him having two partners now? still fucked up). He said I'm being a homophobic asshole, and that I don't know how hard it is to come out. He said that if I don't accept him, I'm a bigot. He made mistakes and what not. I said maybe I will forgive him if he improves his behaviour to his wife, and he said he resents her for keeping him from sleeping with men for years. I gave up at this point.

These weeks have been the most difficult I have ever experienced and it is with great sadness that I tell you all that my beautiful and cat crazy wife, has passed. I've had to cut this short due to character limits, sorry all. But, she did leave all of you a note, Reddit. I've copied everything verbatim below. She truly loved everyone and was smiling so much after her first post. I'll take my leave here. Much love.\n",

      "\"Reddit! If you're reading this, I am dead. Pretty crazy to be talking to a dead person, eh? It feels a bit strange to be writing this. If this feels a bit disconnected, I'm sorry. I have to take frequent breaks as I get tired pretty quickly now. My husband offered to write these words (such a sweet ham, I know. Be nice to him, okay?). But, I wanted my last words to be written by me. Long story short, we talked to my parents. A lot of people asked about why my husband wasn't planning the funeral and my parents were taking control. Honestly, my parents didn't take the news of my passing to come well and I suppose their closure(?) was to try and take control of what they could. I'm not angry at them for it, I understand. They had already pre-paid a large portion of the service and to put it plain and simple, it was a shit hand they were dealt. So, we talked to them. I laid it all out for them and somehow, we reached a compromise. Lots of tears. Lots of hugs. And surprisingly, lots of laughs. They admitted that they had been losing their faith with everything that had happened and their way to attempt to find it again was to take control and \"guide me\" into the afterlife. Not my thing though and I explained that I am not them, but their daughter who wanted to live her last weeks in peace, not the turmoil they were putting me through. And while a lot of people stated that funerals are for the living (true true), I firmly believe that a funeral is for the living to remember that person as WHO they were, not what anyone else wanted them to be. My parents seemed to understand when I told them that. They were not on board with the party favor aspect though, kind of a bummer. Pretty lucky to plan my own funeral, honestly. But, now that that is all said and done! Thank you, guys. I was blown away by the responses.I was moved to tears and I wish I had had the chance to meet every single one of you. You all be good now, ight? Take it one day at a time and fucking enjoy yourself! You only get one life, unless you're someone who has survived death than you're just a fucking hero and probably a cat with a few lives to spare. I love you all. I'm resting easy now. This disease sucks and I'm happy to be rid of it. And laugh and love and cry and be sad. Shit happens. I've got to go now, I'm gonna go snuggle my husband and my cats. Keep it real, Reddit.

No one in my family knew my parents were using me as essentially a free care service for my sister. My grandpa told me some things that I don't feel comfortable repeating here but in essence my sister is \"supposed\" to be getting care from a professional and that my parents were ignoring that, along with this I was not supposed to be caring for her at all with her mental state as apparently she is a danger to herself and others. With everything else I told him, along with stuff like the movie indecent he was really mad and told me to not contact my parents without him there. He pretty much told me that he would be meeting with my parents beforehand and that he was going to be there when I sat down with them. It didn't end here either, the rest of the week consisted of other family checking in on me and telling me things my parents hid from me. This included the fact that my parents have been taking money from family to fund a \"caretaker\" that doesn't exist.\n",

      "Suffice to say, this week has been rough. But, the upside is that even through all this, my extended family has been giving me more love than i've felt in a while.

My aunts and uncles have also been helping me through the week.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, Saturday night I sat down with parents to talk. It went badly to say the least. They came clean to me about everything. They told me things I will not repeat here. But they did not apologize. My parents still claim that I some how owed my sister my time. My father even saying \"You were put here to be her caretaker\". I won't lie and say I was composed. After everything i learned I confronted them. On the fact that my sister needed a caretaker. The money my dad was taking from his sister, and a few other things. They denied it or made excuses. And in the end, we ended off in a worse place than before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today will be my last time talking to them for a while. After talking with my grandfather and uncle last night, I'm not going back. Later today i'm going there and picking up my stuff and moving in with my grandfather. When I graduate high school i'm planning on leaving the state to go to school. My aunt has told me that the money she was sending my dad will be instead be coming to me from now on. My parents have called me twice since Saturday, neither of them were to apologize and only ask when I was coming home.\n",
      "\n",
      "I won't be going back to them. Right now I still feel pretty uneasy about everything but I feel like that will pass. The rest of my family is showing their support to me and honestly, it feel great. But in the end I lost my parents. Over all of this, i've learned something that I wished I saw earlier. I don't hat my sister. In fact I love her with all my heart. I should never have never projected my hate onto her. That was wrong, and someday I hope to make up for it.

      "I am a high schooler with a weekend job at a coffee shop. My coworkers who work weekends are: \n",
      "\n",
      "James - the owners son, he goes to my school. He's a shift manager but it's not a real formal thing, he's a friendly guy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Danielle - A college student who sometimes works weekends too.\n",
      "\n",
      "So sometimes customers will come in and just be angry about such little stuff. Like literally blow up about nothing. I dunno if theyre in a bad mood already and looking for someone to take it out on or what, but it's a lot... Like how sad so your have to be to be a grown-ass man taking your anger out on high school and college kids.\n",
      "\n",
      "So James and I were joking about having a little fun with them and hopefully getting them off our backs.\n",
      "\n",
      "So one day I was at work and some guy was having a temper about how we don't make the coffee hot enough... Which I couldn't do a thing about because I gave it to him right out of the machine.\n",
      "\n",
      "So James came in and was like \"sir is there a problem here\" and the guy started ranting at him too. So he was just like \"OP, this is unacceptable, you're fired.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "I started acting real sad, like \"no please don't fire me, my family needs the money, I need this job, pleaseeee\" and he played up being a hard-ass, telling me to take off my apron and leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "The angry guy started to backtrack, like \"It isn't that big of a problem, you don't need to fire her over it. I didn't mean it\" and James was like \"No, we pride ourselves on the best customer service\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course after all that drama I still had my job, we were just acting. And we've done it a couple times, whenever a customer will lose their temper at Danielle or I, James will storm in and \"fire\" us. And almost every time, the person who had come in angry will apologise and say that they didn't mean it. It's kind of satisfying, making people realize their actions might actually have consequences. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, I was telling my friends from school about this and a few of them thought it was a mean prank, to let someone go away thinking they'd gotten someone who desperately needs the money fired.\n",

      "Note. My step-daughter, Madeline, was about a year old when I married her mother, Jessica. Madeline’s father died before she was born. \n",
      " \n",
      "Madeline is currently 15, and she’s rebelling for almost everything. She did something bad, so while picking her up, I set a punishment up for her. Then she said “You’re not my dad. I don’t have to follow you”. Honestly, I got a bit hurt from that. But I understand that she didn’t mean it, and that she’d probably change. I just replied “I’m still your legal guardian for the next 3 years, and as long as your in my house, you have to follow my rules.” \n",
      " \n",
      "That happened about 2 days ago. So our family was going grocery shopping, when Madeline said “I’m hungry. I need food.” I decide to be extremely cheeky and say “Hi Hungry, I’m not your dad.” My son just started to laugh uncontrollably. My daughter was just quiet with embarrassment. And my wife was berating me “Not to stoop down to her level.” \n",
      " \n",
      "I honestly thought it was a funny dad joke. And my son agrees. So AITA?\n",
      " \n",
      "Edit: I did adopt her. So legally I am her parent.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "Mini Update: I’ll probably give a full update later but here is what happened so far. I go to my daughter’s room after dinner and begin talking with her. “Hey. I’m really sorry that I hurt you by the words I said. And I am really your dad. I changed your diapers, I met your boyfriend, and I plan on helping you through college. And plus I’m legally your dad, so we’re stuck together. But seriously, I’m going to love you like my daughter even if you don’t think I’m your dad. Then I hugged her. She did start to cry. I assume that’s good.\n",

It was filled with a picture of every dessert I've baked and pictures of me baking  and her eating. She wrote a paragraph about each item I baked. Each item was dated too. She had been working on this for 2 years. She also wrote a long letter on how proud she is of my baking hobby, thanking me for the sweets, and telling me how much she loves me.

      "ESH. Your girlfriend sounds super sweet and thoughtful, I love the idea of that gift. I don’t think your family was right in being pissed that you baked a lot for your gf and not really for them, but at the same time I see where they’re coming from. I get that you want to give everything to your gf as a form of appreciation, but surely you could’ve left some for your family as well. Obviously it shouldn’t be expected, but assuming you come from a good family (ignore this if not) that has done nice stuff for you/taken care of you, you should’ve considered if they’d want to try some too. They might be more hurt than mad that you decided to involve only your gf in your hobby and not them\n",

As a parent it probably would be dissapointing your children not only put their girlfriend or boyfriend first, but not even once included them in the hobby to any extent.\n",

But it depends on how many times you have baked for your family because I would find it kinda weird if my brother/son baked for his gf 100 times and never did it for the family he loves and lives with over 2 years. Given how much it meant to your gf you dont think your family would have really appreciated your baking as well?\n",

      "OP, you are definitely NTA. Your mom and sis are the assholes for responding that way. They should be SO happy for you, that you have such a thoughtful, dedicated, and appreciative girlfriend.  Seriously dude, this is some next level shit on both your parts. You guys are young, so chances are high you won’t end up together, but I really hope that you take a serious lesson in how to show appreciation from this experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think your mom and sis are just feeling very bitter because they likely haven’t had anyone put in this much effort for them. Seriously, you’ve been baking your GF something basically every week for two years. And your GF, how amazing!, secretly put together an incredibly thorough scrapbook celebrating a baking milestone between the two of you. I’m not surprised that inspired some jealousy, but I am surprised that they let it show that much.\n",

In these kinds of scenarios, you gotta realize that hobbies like baking should be done only if you want to (that's what makes it a hobby!).

To do so would be taking advantage of you, and make your hobby no longer enjoyable. \n",

      "\n",
      "I have history with my parents. I have been cooking since I was 12 (35 years,)  And, they would criticize what I made when THEY asked me to cook.  They made fun of me for putting carrots in a lot of stuff (I love one dish meals, and at the time I loved carrots.) They raised me not to complain about any food you are given. You eat what was made and are grateful for it.  Yet, THEY constantly criticized the cooking of a teen who was learning. I stopped cooking for them much,  around the time I met my husband at age 21. Now, I am over age 45 and they beg for my food, but I have trouble making it for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "My in-laws often think my food is too fancy, so we usually bring cookies or a boring church cookbook casserole to their house on holidays (we don't see them much, b/c they are kind of assholes, live far away, and never call us--yet get offended when we don't call or come see them. )\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess my point is that cooking and baking are sometimes acts of love for people. We want people to appreciate our work and what we do, and if they don't, or we think they won't, we may not want to do it. You should never be forced to cook or bake for anyone. I truly believe there is a good reason that you don't want to bake for them. You may not know that reason consciously, but  deep down, you do know.\n",

If they (your mother and sister, going forward YMAS) feel this entitled to *all* the cool stuff you do, not just the thoughtful romantic stuff, then it's a sign they could have trouble letting go when you go to culinary school and become a successful pastry chef in Las Vegas or something equally wonderful. (But seriously, if you're enjoying it this much, business degree and/or culinary school might be a great career to start researching.) \n",
      "\n",
      "YMAS may not be constant attention-seekers jealous of your high school GF, and if that's the case then they may just be surprised by the scope and depth of the effort you put into the desserts when it's all condensed into an awesome scrapbook. It's hard to find guys who put in a lot of effort, especially at your age. Somewhere along the way someone was a good example to you of how to be a caring partner. It would just be weird if seeing that makes YMAS feel like they're entitled to all of your time and attention instead of your GF.\n",

It's delicious. Anyway there's nothing wrong with making stuff for your girlfriend. But there's nothing wrong with your family wanting to try your desserts either. They handled it the wrong way. But I could see my family getting upset if they knew I made 100 desserts that they never got to try. Maybe save a few pieces for your family.\n",

      "NAH - I don't think you're an asshole at all for baking for your girlfriend, but I don't think your family is either. It seems like you must be baking things almost weekly, do you use your family's baking supplies that they bought? Do you ever think about baking anything for your family or is it always for your girlfriend? You can absolutely do what you want with what you bake, hence why I don't think you're the asshole, but it might be nice to make something for your family especially if you use ingredients they buy (which again IDK if you do, you could be buying them all on your own in which case I still think there are no assholes here). My brother is getting into baking and offers me stuff all the time, especially when it's something he knows I like. I would be hurt if he gave his girlfriend hundreds of baked goods and I never got one. I wouldn't think he's an asshole but I don't think I would be an asshole for feeling hurt either, so again I think there are no assholes here.\n",

So if they’re disappointed to not get anything from you although they raised and care about you - I fully understand that. And if you have to tell someone „oh it would be nice to get a dessert from you someday too“ than that’s weird to. The person should remember before them telling you...I mean you stated you do it because you see it makes your gf happy and you want her to be happy.\n",

      "2) Let’s say their feelings were just hurt, hurt feelings sometimes get expressed as anger. Healthy would discuss again when everyone was calm, apologize for anger and the. Express the actual need. The fact that you are feeling GUILT in this scenario sounds more like manipulation. \n",

There's nothing wrong with spending a ton of time with your girlfriend, but that doesn't change the fact that it sucks to miss someone, especially if it's a family member you've never had to put effort into your relationship with before. If this is all true, it's still their fault for not managing their own emotions (especially your mom) but it might be nice for all of you if you try to increase the *quality* of the time you spend together\n",

      "NTA. This is such a beautiful gift. It's incredibly thoughtful. Share pictures if you feel comfortable doing so! Anyway, in regards to my judgment: your girlfriend has proven to be extremely grateful of your treats, and she has helped you cultivate something you love so much. I'm sure if you ever felt like not baking for a while, she wouldn't mind. Your family however, seems to think they are owed something, when this is absolutely not the case. If you feel like defending your point, tell your mother and sister that they haven't showed as much gratitude as you would like them to.\n",

People will 100%take for granted that I have the time, energy and desire to make them a cake for free just because we know each other. I had one person want me to make the same cake set up (flavor and cake/cupcake combo) for their wedding that I had at mine and they asked this right after what would have been my first anniversary had my husband not died a couple months before. There have been a number of times that people have said I could make my own birthday cake. There are even more times that I've just been full on voluntold that I was making the cake for some event.  \n",

Your family is upset over a non-issue. There’s no reason for them to be so salty over something so small. Baking is something you enjoy sharing with your girlfriend. Your family thinking that you have to do the same things for them that you do for your girlfriend is irrational. You wouldn’t buy your mom and sister a dozen roses, chocolates, and a fancy dinner for Valentine’s Day. If your mom had said something along the lines of “why don’t you bake me desserts??” and said it playfully/teasingly that would be one thing. But to be genuinely mad about it?

      "I'm in a similar situation. I love baking. But I only do so when I actually feel like it. I've been busy, so I don't bake as often. The times I have baked, I've made cookies and cake for my friends, and their birthdays. My family always demands that I make something for them. Had they requested it politely, I would've done it. But they never put my feelings into consideration, and expect me to give them everything I have, on command. They get upset with me that I would rather bake for \"those people\" (I have friends of mixed races) instead of my own flesh and blood. My mother especially loves it when I bake sweets because she goes out of her way to announce to everyone in our family and her circle of friends that I can bake, and that I'm taking requests, without even asking me first. She doesn't do it because she's proud of me, she does it because she has always been highly competitive, and narcissistic when it comes to shit like sibling rivalry. I enjoy baking as a hobby. It stops being enjoyable once I feel like I'm being forced to do it. (Which has happened before.)\n",

      "NTA - 17M and also love baking, if my mom did that to me I’d be pissed.  Baking, and preparing food as a whole, is best enjoyed when done for people who truly appreciate it.  To me it sounds like your family is more greedy than appreciative.  The point of a hobby is to have fun doing something you love, and if my family pressured me to bake for them like that it’d feel more like a chore than a hobby.  You aren’t obligated to bake for anybody, and don’t let them make you think otherwise.\n",

Have you ever baked for your family? Baking 100 things to impress a girl but nothing for your own mother is a little thoughtless and harsh. Also, do you purchase all of your own ingredients when you bake or do you use what's in your mother's kitchen that she bought for the family? \n",

But it shows a lack of emotional intelligence and a failure to be considerate of those around you as you are probably taking those relationships for granted. The reality is you're probably going to break up at some point but your mom and sister will still be your family. I've seen this happen with a handful of people and they lead very lonely lives now. Ex girlfriends make for terrible friends/ support systems as the motivation to invest in you drops dramatically after the spark is gone. \n",

      "NAH - it’s a courtesy thing. Your post implies the only baking you ever do is for your gf. Assuming if you still live with your parents they make you dinner, the least you can do to show your appreciation is to let them try some of the food you make. No, you’re not OBLIGED to, but it’s rather inconsiderate not to. The other aspect of this missing is that baking is not usually something that only results in one or two items- where are the rest going? Is she taking all of them? Are you hoarding them in your room? All I’m saying is it’s really not that hard to let them sample it. For those saying they should have asked, some people come from guess culture where that’s considered rude. I can see why they’d be at least annoyed when it’s being displayed outright the high volume of food and love you’ve been giving/showing her over the last 2 years and they haven’t seen ANY of it.\n",

Well, that’s extrapolating beyond the situation you’ve described, but that’s just my two cents. Maybe just have a sit down with them to say that you do care for both your gf and your family, assuming they’re the type who would listen.\n",

      "Wtf. Way to be encouraging of you for learning a lifelong skill and engaging in a fulfilling hobby with someone you love! Congrats, man, baking can take you a lot of places in this world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I take it you're doing most of this baking at your house where your family lives with you. Have they ever expressed interest in your hobby as you were doing all this baking? Have they noticed your work and requested sweets for home? Maybe they have been interested and just haven't been direct enough... And if you're using your family kitchen, dishes, and/or ingredients purchased by mom, then the considerate thing to do is to pay a little dessert tax to the fam for the privilege, regardless of whether or not they ask you for it. Maybe all that baking that they constantly smell has been building up the resentment and they haven't wanted to say anything until now. However, you're 16, and life is a learning experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "To summarize: they didn't handle it great, they could've shown interest in your hobby more directly if the tasty smells were driving them nuts. But also, as a family member using shared space and shared equipment, it would be more considerate to sometimes leave some baking that's for the household. But that's a lesson in etiquette that occurs to very few young people, and you had your focus on the very utilitarian matter of having this special thing that you and your gf share. There was room here for more kindly worded instruction on the matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit to add... I'm changing my ruling on this one, it's such a squeaker for me that I'm requesting INFO:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Who's been purchasing all your baking ingredients? I mean both special ingredients and pantry staples, if your family keeps a stocked pantry that you're making extensive use of, that's a factor. If you were out there at 14 spending your money from odd jobs on flour and sugar, bravo, my dude!\n",
      "2. Where/when is the baking happening? How often is your family kitchen tied up with this baking (regardless of whether or not others seemed like they wanted to use it, cause you never know what others have going on)? It sounds like an average of once a week that you're regularly baking up a storm?\n",
      "3. Please please OP tell me that you're cleaning up all your dishes (and the kitchen) when you bake. And I mean all of them. Within 24 hrs of finishing, but hopefully less than that. Yes?\n",
      "\n",
      "It's with these in mind that I'm inclined to go easy on your family for being (admittedly) rude... But if you're being a good and responsible baker, then I rule in your favor.\n",

Being told 100 in 2 years vs being shown 100 has a different impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "So yeah, OP, I think you could've shared without them having to ask. I'm not saying make them a whole cake, bit I'm sure your girlfriend would've been as happy with 10 cookies than she was with 12. Parents are allowed to show emotions, once again, it's how they show it that matters.\n",

I know that sounds super petty, but I grew up pretty poor, so using ingredients all the time for someone outside of the family and never for the family would have gotten me in a lot of trouble. Now if you're spending your allowance or working for the money to buy the ingredients yourself, they have no place being upset at you for using your money for something you love to do\n",

      "It seems like baking is one of the ways you express love, so ig your family felt like you didn’t prioritize them in your affections as much as you did ur gf. Especially if you haven’t baked for them at  all. I think it is less about them feeling entitled to ur food, and more about them feeling excluded from your thoughtfulness.  But I think that you didn’t do it on purpose and that baking was more of a thing between you and your gf, rather than you and everyone you have a relationship with. Just make it clear that in your mind, baking was a romantic thing and you didn’t mean to exclude them. Obviously my interpretation would be different if they were demanding and mean, rather than hurt and confused. Also, fun hobby and great gf!\n",

I used to make these really great cookies whenever I was happy or in love, and I remember my mom telling me I *had* to make them once for a family event. I didn't feel like it, and even though I put the same ingredients in, the cookies just didn't taste very good in the end. I think your desserts for your girlfriend are probably that much better for how happy they make her and you, and that desserts made for your sister and mother might end up as bitter as they are being. \n",

      "NTA - its okay if you do enjoy cooking to her and only her. I LOVE to cook, im not very good at it, but i still try my best to make my family happy with my food, but they usually just... Ignore it... It hurts a little so i just cook less and less, but one time i cook for a cousin and she enjoyed it so much and make me so happy. Probably its kinda the same with you, yo cook for her because she shows you she love it, and you Probably love feeling that gratitude, and, of course, if your family is pissed of for something as stupid like \"WhY dIdnT yOu cOoK foR uS?!\" you would probably dont want to cook for them, as they are kinda trying to force you to make something for them. You wouldn't enjoy cooking for them, so you wouldn't care feeling their gratitude as you didnt want to give your food to them at the end. Something like when in christmass you have to give something to your annoying little cousin because otherwise your aunt would be angry at you. Your cousin looks happy, but you dont care at all, you didn't want to make him happy.\n",

      "NTA however is there a bigger picture here where you could be making more of an effort in other ways for them that you don’t? The reason I (F29) am asking is because my brother (32) goes way over and beyond for his gf - booking surprise holidays to Disneyland (we live in Europe so that’s pretty expensive as a gift and he wouldn’t have a lot of disposable income), he calls me and my mum to get ideas for presents for her at Xmas and her birthday, gives her lifts (I think Americans call it rides) anytime she wants and spends every spare moment he has with her.. which is great for them but he makes zero effort with me or my mum and when we rarely see him all he talks about is her and her family, what her opinions are about whatever the topic of conversation is.. basically she is his whole world.\n",
      "\n",
      "He would never call me to ask me how I am or instigate any form of communication other than when he has a problem or needs advice e.g. both of his previous break ups. I honestly don’t mind because I’m busy and am very happy in my own life. I have just kind of accepted that’s the way he is. He can also be pretty insensitive (says things without thinking) but I just laugh it off. \n",
      "\n",
      "My mum on the other hand has been through a lot - she was very ill for a few years and I had to remind him to contact her and ask her how she is / if he can do anything for her because she told me he doesn’t seem to care that she’s even in hospital (this was a few years ago). I have to text him to remind him of Mother’s Day and her birthday every year. My parents every few months pass a comment about him not making any effort with them other than when he contacts them when he needs something like a tax form, birth cert, career advice. Neither of us live at home for years and he never calls over to say hi or have dinner with them. He’s very babyish in a lot of ways, he finds it very hard to read signals from people, to empathise with someone or to consider others feelings.. not in a horrible way, they just don’t click for him.. hence why I never take things personally. \n",
      "\n",
      "My point is because of all of this my mum gets quite upset that he can seem to do all of the nice gestures for a girlfriend and seems to forget about his own family. I know she said last xmas she didn’t want to know about his girlfriends present when he was going on and on about it. He was very confused by this because he just doesn’t get the bigger picture and it wasn’t really about her Xmas present... so it might not be about the baking? I’ve no idea what your relationship is like with your family but that’s my side of one situation as a sister, hope it helps. \n",
      "\n",
      "I will say both of my parents are absolutely amazing, a great team, so loving. They have instilled really good morals in us all and have always put us before any of their needs and wants. They poured money into any extra classes we needed grinds in as kids - sports, dancing classes, music lessons.. anything we wanted (except materialistic things we didn’t need so we were not spoilt in that way) while cutting back on themselves to afford this. They really showed us how to work hard, earn our keep and have given us amazing life skills so there’s no reason for my brother to be like this, he just is the way he is.\n",

Out of all the times you were baking, you couldn’t just spend the extra few effort to add an extra batch for the family? Who puts a roof over your head and provides you a meal everyday? And think about any other time your family has helped you in anything. IMO it’s just basic courtesy to look out for your family at least once in a while.\n",

      "Not involved but to put in perspective how weird that is When I was a freshman I dated this kid (I apparently went to preschool with him), and then I didn’t have school with him until high school. I low key was only interested in him Bc my mom mentioned that, but he was also like in that mid point of not popular but not unpopular. Mostly Bc he was smart but not cocky and communicative but introverted (open but quiet?). I ended up getting a complex Bc he liked having a gf but didn’t like the attention or the personal involvement involved in a relationship, and I couldn’t comprehend that. So for his birthday I baked him rubix cube cookies.it was in an angle where you’re looking from a corner and can see 3 sides of the cube at an angle, and I icing decorated as such. It took until 3:20 am to finish, with my moms help, and when I took it to him the next day, he said ‘thanks! These look cool.’ And shut the door. Also not to mention we were 2 streets over, so I walked up this big ass hill alone to receive said message. Anyways the parents/ older brother never said anything to me, but I learned years later his mom sent my mom a Facebook message saying she thought the cookies were rly well done. Through the entire relationship she never commented on me giving to her, or etc. just tried to keep the preschool mom bonding Alive. (Also we good now we went to prom together senior year platonically and are good friends)\n",

Even if this is the case they should keep this to themselves, especially when you're showing them something that you're happy about. That was a bad move by them. They may also feel as if she is stealing you from them. Of course i dont know anything about the nature of your relationship between you and your mum, sis but it sounds like your gf is really kind and thoughtful. If it comes between her and your family, i would choose her. You can always make up with your family if you want to, but if you push her away i doubt she will come back\n",

It is an awesome hobby to bake, and what you do with your creations is totally up to you, but I could see from your family's perspective that if you're basically freeloading for all the requirements of the activity and never sharing the result with them that there is a disparity there. Of course getting mad is the least productive way to remedy that on their part, if that is in fact even the case of what is happening, but perhaps to totally avoid being the AH it would be best to acknowledge any contributions your family makes to your baking and repay it with some of the treats\n",

      "NTA. 100 deserts over 2 years? That’s not excessive. So, over approx 730 days you took 100 of those days, and a few hours in those days to woo your lady.  If you changed baking treats to taking her in dates, your mom probably wouldn’t even blink. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was really sweet of you lady to remember to and take the time to make this  scrap book for you. It shows thought and care, just like you were showing thought and care with these little gestures.  I’m gonna wager at theory though, that your mom’s reaction is not about you. \n",
      "\n",
      "Humans are inherently self involved. We can’t help it, and it’s not necessarily a bad thing. Our first thought is about our needs and wants, because we need to focus on our need and wants to survive. When we don’t, we suffer, we burn out emotionally and physically. Think about the disposition of enablers, often they are miserable because instead of taking care of themselves to make sure they are there for others, they can put everyone else ahead of them and feel resentful and drained because they are trying to get what they need from other people. On the flip we may not recognize when we take too much. Like when you have a friend who is always listing to you about your problems but you never think to ask how they are, or has someone who always pays for you or does something for the betterment of the group. We are social animals, and part of growing up is to recognize that while you do need to prioritize yourself, you’re not alone in this world. It’s about balance, care for others, care for yourself to, and give back to those who give to you. \n",
      "\n",
      "So back to your mom. I could be off base, but if she was anything like my mom growing up she may feel like everything she does is thankless. Yeah that’s what you sign up for when you become a parent. You put your life into raising a person who may never be grateful for all that you gave up for them. What might have happened when your mom saw the scrapbook is that she felt a bit jealous perhaps. Maybe nobody has ever done that kind of thing for her, not growing up, not in a romantic relationship, and not from anyone in the family. Like I said, 100 deserts over 2 years isn’t much when you think about it, but seeing this consistent gesture of care can hurt if you’ve never had it, and now it’s presented to her. I’m sure over the past two years she saw you baking in the kitchen for your GF, so that you do this shouldn’t be a surprise. That’s why I think this emotional reaction isn’t about you. She knows you do this already, but only now asks why you don’t bake for the family? \n",
      "\n",
      "You should never feel under obligation to use your skills when you don’t want to. My brother loves to grill. It’s his hobby. He spends a lot of time on educating himself, collecting equipment, and when he smokes or grills he puts a lot of care into it. But we don’t ask him to, when he does it it’s an expression of care for the family. If we demanded he did it, it wouldn’t be as fun for him, or for us really.  Perhaps if he only did it for his wife and not the rest of us.... it’s his right to do as he wishes, but it can be... perceived that if he doesn’t show that same care for others that are important in his life that... maybe he didn’t care as much for the rest of us. \n",
      "\n",
      "You’re not the asshole here. You are under no obligation to do anything you don’t want with this hobby of yours. I would say that you might want to consider that the way you show that you care for your GF, could also be used to show you care for others. Maybe, perhaps, your mom needs you to show her you care now and then. She may not say it, or ask for it, and possibly saying “you need to bake for the family”  is a way to make her need for care not about her. Just.... well Mother’s Day is coming up in the US very soon. Make something nice for you mom. If you can talk about it, say you like baking as a gift, which is true. Now that you know she would appreciate these kinds of gifts, you will keep that in mind. Don’t bake out of obligation... but maybe, perhaps, extend that level of care beyond your girlfriend who appreciates it so much.  Everyone needs a little affection now and then.\n",
      "\n",
      "Footnote, for the folks saying “well she could of just asked when he was making something if she could have some”. Asking for a gift is tacky, and asking for part of someone else’s gift is very tacky. Sometimes people may hint that they want you to do the same nice thing for them, but outright asking can come off as greedy or off putting. Exactly how it comes off as greedy and off putting when OP’s mom got upset. People close to you often won’t ask for you to show them affection. You may find that you want a hug or something from someone but you don’t want to prompt them. You just want them to give you affection because they want to, not because you had to ask for it. This is good to keep in mind, because if you remember to reach out more, people will be more inclined to reach back, AKA we get what we give. Sometimes we have to be the one who reaches first. The mom didn’t want to ask, because she wanted OP to give her a gift because he wanted to is what I am saying. This is an easy fix really. OP’s mom for certain could have been more graceful about it, but parents are not perfect. Nobody is\n",

However, regardless of if they asked for dessert or not, you’re still living with your family. They won’t make you a scrapbook for all your desserts because you’re not dating them, but I’m sure they would enjoy and be appreciative if you made some for them. You live in the same house, making any kind of food is like doing the dishes or taking out the trash, you shouldn’t have to be asked. It should be “well I’m making these for my girlfriend, I’ll make an extra one for my family to try”. Hopefully they take care of you, provide for you, and raise you well; and even if you buy ingredients with your own money, you’re still using time is the kitchen that is a shared area, possibly when your family’s home. I would be hurt as well if my son didn’t think of me when cooking for other people.\n",

They can be happy for you AND want to partake at the same time. \n",

      "Don’t stop baking. I’m not good at baking but there’s been at least a handful of days in the last year when I’ve felt so incredibly depressed, stuck, completely paralyzed, and plain old down that the only thing to make be stand up and be remotely human was to bake some cookies. If it’s something you enjoy, and your gf (who seems so sweet and it makes me so happy that she appreciates it!) also gets joy from it, and then you get more joy from her enjoying your bake—- just keep doing it. Don’t let them crush it. \n",

      "Although not on purpose, but this is your family. These people wiped your ass and raised you. I was sixteen once and I get the extremely myopic view of teenagers. It’s hard to appreciate your family and of course girlfriend takes precedence at that age (I did the same thing at 16, I’m 27 and taught teenagers), but as you get older you’re going to realize it’s a pretty shitty move to not do things for your actual family. You don’t necessarily  have to bake for them all the time but it would be a kind thing to share your talent with them. After all, these people know you for your entire life and will hopefully be there through thick and thin. Again, it’s hard to not be a selfish teenager but really think about all that you have because of your. It’s not hard to bake double or split the yield. Who’s oven are you using? Who’s house are you living in? Who has always been there for you?\n",
