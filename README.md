This website hosts the course materials for "Introduction to Cultural Analytics: Data, Computation & Culture," an undergraduate course taught at Cornell in the spring of 2020. It includes an online textbook designed for the class.

For a quick breakdown of what's in this repository and how it functions as a Jupyter Book, see [Quick Jupyter Book Overview and Directory Structure](JupyterBookOverview.md).

## What is Cultural Analytics?
Cultural analytics is the study of culture with computational methods. Culture is a broad term that includes literature, history, politics, art, music, social media, and a lot more. Cultural analytics is a growing research area in fields like [Digital Humanities](https://cmu-lib.github.io/dhlg/what-are-dh/) and [Information Science](https://infosci.cornell.edu/research). 

## Python for Cultural Data 
The *Introduction to Cultural Analytics & Python* textbook offers an introduction to the programming language Python that is specifically designed for humanities students and scholars with no previous programming experience. It demonstrates how Python can be used to study cultural materials such as song lyrics, short stories, newspaper articles, tweets, Reddit posts, and film screenplays. It introduces computational methods such as web scraping, APIs, topic modeling, Named Entity Recognition (NER), network analysis, and mapping.
